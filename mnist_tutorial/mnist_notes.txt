Introduction: Run the hello world of machine learning. Follow along to the MNIST for ML Beginners tutorial at https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.10/tutorials/mnist/beginners/index.html#mnist-for-ml-beginners.

Problem: Train a machine learning model to predict which number is shown in an image of a handwritten digit. 

Used:
Tensorflow
MNIST dataset

Method:
1. Run mnist_lnrclssfr.py, e.g. $ python mnist_lnrclssfr.py

Observations:
1. When running the script, the expected output should be:
Extracting MNIST_data/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
Extracting MNIST_data/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
Extracting MNIST_data/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz
Extracting MNIST_data/t10k-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz
0.918

This means the script downloaded the MNIST dataset successfully (a folder named MNIST_data will have been created for you) and that the model achieved a ~91% accuracy when predicting what number the handwritten digit in the image was.
The script took ~10 seconds to execute. (WOW! I know it’s a simple model but how is it so fast?.)

Errors:
1. debugging related - moved the line declaring and initialising the ‘sess’ variable before the for loop when error was raised. 

2. troubleshooting related - when downloading tensorflow for Python 3.5/OSX, I used pip instead of pip3. pip3 caused a traceback error with something related to the conda distribution.
