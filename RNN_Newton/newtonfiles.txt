Of Drawing.
Instruments of drawing.
Pens made of Raven quils. thick & smooth paper. & light coulored blew paper. fine parchment. a flat thin bras ruler. a paire of compasses. a wing. & sundry plummetts. & pestells to draw with=all.
Of plummets.
Ther are naturall plummetts not made. as blacklead. black chalk. charecole {split}. red stone. white chalke. & there are artificiall plummits. Thus made.
Take a great chalk stone & make furrows in it 2 or 3 inches long & so wide as you may lay a quil in each of them. Then take a proportion of white chalke ground verry fine, temper it with aile, or wort & a little new milke, & soe make pap thereof: then power it into the furrows of the chalke. you may soone tak them out & role them up, or let them lie in the chalk till they be quite dry & then take them out & scrape them into a hansome forme.
You may temper Lake with burnt Alabaster for a red. &
Alabaster burnt & bice for a blew. & so for others: regarding some {illeg} that will bind over hard which must have a little water put on them in their grinding.
<3v>
Of Drawing with the pen
Let the thing which you intend to draw stand before you, so that the light be not hindred from falling upon it. & with a pointed peice of charecole draw it rudely & lightly when you have don see if it be well don; if not wipe out with your wing & begin agine, & so draw it till it bee well. then wipe it over gently with your wing, so that you may perceive your former strokes; then with your black chalk or pensill draw it perfectly & curiously as you can, & shaddow it as the light falleth upon it. If you draw on blew paper when you have finished your draught wet your paper in fair wait & let it dry of it self. & so the drawing will hold fast on.
Of Drapery.
Draw the utmost lines of your garment, & the greater folds first which continue through the whole garment, then break the greater folds into lesse, & so shaddow them.
Of Landskip.
If you express the sunn make it riseing or setting behind some hill; but never expres the moone or starrs but upon necessity.
Of Emblem or Empresse work.
In drawing after the life sit not nearer than two yards from the partie, & sit of one height. but if the party you draw be very tall let him sit aboue you a little if {short} or a child let him sit a little below you If you draw from the head to the foot let the <4r> the party stand at the least six yards from you. let the party stand for few can sit {illeg} upright as they can stand.
ffirst, draw the stroake for the forehead, which must bee done exactly, because according to that proportion must all the rest bee drawn as if the fore head bee soe long, then must it be twice so long from the forehead to the chin. then draw the farthest eye making the circle of the sight perfectly round & placing the reflection of the sight which appeareth as a white speck, acording to the light. 3. draw the nose. forthly the nearest eye, leaving the just lenght of an eye betweene it & the other. 5. Draw the mouth. 6 The chin. 7 finish the out line of the face. & lastly the haire. having finished the head draw the whole body proportionable thereunto.
Of Shaddowing.
To shaddow sweetly & rowndly withall is a far greater cunning than to shaddow hard & darke; for it best to shaddow as if it were not shaddowed.
To take a perfect drawgh of a picture.
Take a sheet of venise or of the finest paper you can get, wet it all over with cleane salitt oyle, then wipe the sallett away so that the paper may be dry throughly. then lay the paper on the picture, & you shall see the picture through the paper, & then with a pensill draw it over, & then with a pen. Then take of the oyled paper & lay it on a cleane sheete, & with a stick pointed, or a fether of a swallow <4v> wing, draw it over againe, & you shall have it neatly drawne on the white paper.
Another way.
Take some Lake & grind it fine & temper it with linseed oyle, & then with a pen & this mixture draw out all the great strokes of any picture & also the {mustler} Wet then the contrary side of the picture, & pre{ss} it hard upon the sheet of cleane paper & it will leave behind it al the stroks you drew.
An easy way to lesson or enlarge a picture
Make a square, & then divide it into divers equall parts with the compasses, & draw o'rethwart lines with a ruler & a pensill, so that the pictur be divided into equall squares, & so make squares on a faire paper as little or big as you will, but let ther bee soemany, as there is in the picture, then observing the order of the squares draw the pictur over with a pensill pasing from square to square.

Of a perpetuall Lamp.
The wike may be made of Salamanders wooll, or plumeallum, or linum vivum, otherwise asbestinum which is gotten out of the stone Asbestus or Amantus by bruising it.
(The stone asbestus being set on fire will ever burne)
The oyle must be purged from drosse & be of a tenacius & close substance so that it may slowly evaporate that the{re} may be time for the fume to turne to <19r> oyle againe, the lamp being close{d} up in a glasse.
          Or
A oyle extracted out of some Minerall as if Gold were disolved to an Vnctuous humor, or its radicall moyster seperated from it might burne for many yeares.
          Or
If fire could be detained from flying upward it might be reflected. but neither the humour nor the flame must excede the strenght of one another. & to this purpose it may be possible to extract an inflamable oyle, frome the Stone Asbestus, Amiantus, or Gold; which being of the same pure & homogeneous nature with those bodys shall be so proportioned to theheat of the fier that being on fier it may continue for may ages without sensible diminution.
If the liquor be of a close & glutinous consistency it may burne without any snuffe as in Camphire & some other Glutinous substances.

'Quæstiones quædam Philosophiæ' ('Certain Philosophical Questions')
<88r>
Amicus Plato amicus Aristoteles magis amica veritas.
Questiones quædam Philosophiæ
Off the first mater
Whither it be mathematicall points: or Mathematicall points & parts: or a simple entity before division indistinct: or individualls i.e. Attomes{.}
1 Not of Mathematicall points since what wants dimentions cannot constitute a body in theire conjunction because they will sinke into the same point. An infinite number of mathematicall points sink into one being added together & that being still a mathematicall point is indivisible but a body is divisible. 
Not of parts & Math: points; for such a point is either something or nothing. if something tis a part & so added betweene 2 parts will make a line of 3 parts. if nothing, then added betwixt two parts there is still nothing betwixt the 2 parts & consequently the line consists of nothing still but 2 parts. &
Not of simple entity before division indistinct. for this must be an union of the parts into which a body is divisible since those parts may againe bee united & become one body as they were before at the creation. Now the nature of union (being but a modall ens) is to depend on its parts (which are absolute entities) therefore it cannot be the terme of creation, or first matter for tis a contradiction to say the first matter depends on some other subject since that implys some former matter on which it must depende.
<88v>
The latter will be in its due place be proved impossible
3 Those things which can exist being actually {seperate} are really distinct, but such are the parts of mater.
4 Suppose the first matter one uniforme mass without parts how should that body be divided into parts as we se now it is without admission of a vacuum. Suppose it be divided into two what will be betweene those two parts not body since it is all in the two halfes. But if it be said that it was first divided into smaller parts wee ask how came it so without less parts than those into which it was at first divided or els vacuum to succed in theire rome as they came a peices. Suppose the first matter were divided as small as sand then divide one of those sands a third sand cannot succed twixt 'em before they be at some distance unles there might be some smaler matter to run in & keepe out vacuum but to affirme this is to say the first matter had very little parts in it before it was divided. But againe if now matter is divided two parts of matter of the least size. were seperateing & distant one from another the space & halfe
<89r>
Of Attomes.
It remaines therefore that the first matter must be attoms. And that Matter may be so small as to be indiscerpible the excellent Dr Moore in his booke of the soules imortality hath proved beyond all controversie yet I shall use one argument to shew that it cannot be divisible in infinitum & that is this: Nothing can be divided into more parts than it can possibly be constituted of. But matter (i.e. finite) cannot be constituted of infinite parts. The Major is true for looke into how many parts a thing is divided those parts added agane make that same whole that they were before; & so if any finite quantity were divided into infinite parts (& certainely it may if it be so far divisible) those infinite parts added would make the same finite quantity they were before which is again the Minor; & It is plaine from hence that an infinite number of extendid parts & the least parts of quantity must be extended make a thing infinitely extended this cannot be denyed if I can prove that things infinitely extended have fine parts Now vacuum is infinitely extended & so may matter be fansied to be. but if the world were removed & vacuum came into the roome of it that very vacuum would not be infinite we can conceive of interspersed vacuities amongst matter but they are not infinite (though an infinite number of them would be so) we see the parts of matter are finite. & an infinite number of finite unites cannot be finite. To helpe that conception of the nature of these leasts, how they are indivisible how extended of what figure &c I shall all along draw a similitude from numbers, comparing Math: points to ciphers, indivisible extension, to unites: divisibility, or compound quantity, to number: i.e. a multitude of attomes, to a multitude of unites. Suppose then a number of Mathematicall points were indued with such a power as that they could not touch nor be in one place (for if they touch they will touch all over, & bee in one place) Then ad thees as close in a line as they can stand together every point added must make some extension to the lenght because it cannot sinke into the formers place or touch it so here will be a line which hath partes extra partes; another of these points cannot bee added into the midst of this line, for that implys that the former points did not lie so close but that they might lye closer. The distance then twixt each point is the least that can be & so little may an attome be & no lesse: now that this distance is indivisible (& therefore the matter conteined in it) is thus made plaine: Wherever
<89v>
Of a Vacuum & Attomes. pag 2
halfe theire diameter Vacuum will then come betwixt if nothing else can, & no matter will come betwixt since the diameter of the least particle will be as big againe as that space. As thus suppose two globes were to come together they must pas through all the intermediate degrees of distance before they can be joyned suppose they then be distant but halfe the breadth of the least particle of matter there can be no matter betwixt them since all matter is too big to interpose it self. Neither can the two globes touch for that implyes that semidiameter of the least attome hath no breadth but had it not breadth the diameter could have none & so the least particles of matter would be Mathematicall points. therefore A vacuum must interpose. Vnles you say those attomes are as far divided as they ar divisible that there are least parts of matter is proved in the chapter of attomes.
* i.e. so little that theire can not be a place too little for them to creepe into & then you will grant what I pleade for i.e. indivisible particles. & you must grant too that Attom{es} were either created so or divided by meanes of a Vacuum
<90r>
Of Quantity
As finite lines added in an infinite number to finite lines, make an infinite line: so points added twixt points infinitely, are equivalent to a finite line.
All superficies beare the same proportion to a line yet one superficies may bee greater than another (thesame may be said of bodys in respect of surfaces) which happens by reason that a surface is infinit in respect of a line, soe though all infinite extensions beare thesame proportion to a finite one yet one infinite extension may be greater than another soe one angle of contact may exceed another, yet they are all equal when compared to a rectilinear angle viz which is infinitely greater Thus  is double to  &  is double to  , for multiply the 2 first & divide the 2ds by 0, & there results  :  &  : . yet if  &  have respect to 1 they beare the same relation to it that is 1 :  :: 1 : . & ought therefore to bee considered equall in respect of a unite.
The angle of contact is to another angle, as a point to a line, for the crookednes in one circle amounts to 4 right angles & that crookedness may bee conceived to consist of an infinite number of angles of contact, as a line doth of infinite points.
 As the point a to the line a b so the line a c to the pgr a b c d:: pgr d b e f: the parralelipipedon b g.
Tis indefinite (that is undetermined) how greate a {sphær} may be made how greate a number may be recconed, how far mattar is divisible, how much time or extension wee {c}an fansy but all the extension that is, Eternity,  are infinite {&} exceeds all number & is soe greate that there can bee noe greater, but (finite) number is called indefinite in respect of a greater.
<90v>
Conjunction of bodys.
Whither the conjunction of bodys be from rest: Neg: For then sand by rest might be united sooner than by a furnace &c   
Whither it be from the close crouding of all the matter in the world affirmatur. For the aire (though its pressure bee but little in respect of that, performed by the purer matter of the vortex (twixt  & us) receding from the center) by its pressure to the center & consequently crouding all thing close together betwixt which there is not aire to keepe them asunder it maketh them stick together, as the 2 pollished sides of 2 marbles the {Lots} of water &c but this juncture cannot be very firme by reason that the pressure of the aire is not verry strong as appeares by the experiments of Esquire Boyle. but the pressure of all the matter made by reason of its indevor from . twixt  & us being farr greater (& it may be some other power by which matter is kept close together&c) when 2 or 3 or more littell bodys once touch so as to admitt noe other matter betwixt them they must be held very fast together al the matter about them pressing them together but nothing striving to parte them. And when 2 of the least particles meete whos sides with which they touch one another are pretty broade & fitted to touch close every where, those two may move together as one body & so may increase by haveing others joyned to them in the same manner. but if the circumstant particles chanch to be held of from pressing them together by some accident as those about (a) or be variously pressed as at (b) by the bodys c & d they may be againe severed. yet in more compound bodys there is no danger for the least particles are so wedged together that neither of these two chanches could undo them as for the first it cannot to a whole body but onely in some littell parte of it as some attome of a mans hand may chanch not to be touched by the water into which hee puts it. But this cannot happ to his <91r> whole hand.
so that those particles which are pressed together may holde a particle wedged as it were amongst them so that it cannot fall away from them though it chanch not to be pressed to them. the second can happen at all for the neighbouring matter can onely scarce press two touching particles toward the center or it may be a little awry but not from the body to which they adhere but let the wors hapen that can the particle may be wedged in amongst the rest. But it may be that the particles of compound matter were created bigger than those which serve for other offices.
<91v>
Of Place
Extension is related to places, as time to days yeares &c Place is the principium individuationis of streight lines & of equall & like figures the surfaces of two bodys becoming but one when they are contiguous becaus but in one place.

Of time & Eternity

<92v>
Of Motion
That it may be knowne how motion is swifter or slower consider i That there is a least distance, a least progression in motion & a least degree of time. as lay two globes together so close that they cannot come any nigher with out touching that is the least distance, let them be moved together that is the least degree of motion & tis performed in the least part of time. There are so many parts in a line as there can stand Mathematicall points in a row with out touching (i.e. falling into) one another in it & soe many degrees of motion along that time. as there can be stops & stays. & there are soe many least parts of time in an hower as there can be Τὸ νὺν᾽ς. This proposition is proved as I proved a least part in Matter. 2 These leasts have no parts for that implys that they are yet divisible. neither prius nor posterius 1 not least distance since it is passed over in an indivisible part of time & ther cannot be a different time ascribed to the entrance of a thing into that part of space & the leaving of it. 2 not the least degree of motion because too that is performed in an indivisible parte of time & is no sooner begun than done 3 not the least moment of time because first & last imply severall parts of time. 3 The least degree of motion is equal to the least distance & time 1 distance & not to more: because a thing moves in passing over but one of them. Nor to less, because the least motion is over some distance. 2 Tis æquall to the least moment in time, not to more, because in each degree of time wherein a thing moves there will be motion or else in all those degrees put together there will be none: not to lesse becaus no motion is done in an instant or intervall of time. But againe should two parts in motion be but equall to one in space or time &c contra: that one would be liable to have a prius accor{ding} to the firt of the two parts a midle according to the 
<93r>
Of the Celestiall matter & orbes.
Whither Cartes his first element can turne about the vortex & yet drive the matter of it continually from the  to produce light. & spend most of its motion in filling up the chinkes betwix the Globuli. Whither the least globuli can continue always next the  & yet come always from it to cause light & whither when the  is obscured the motion of the first Element must cease (& so whither by his hypothesis the  can be obscured) & whither upon the ceasing of the first elements motion the Vortex must move slower. Whither some of the first Element comeing (as he confesseth that hee might find out a way to turne the Globuli about their one axis to grate the 3d El{ement} into wrathes like screws or cockle shells) immediately from the poles & other vortexes into all the parts of our vortex would not impel the Globuli so as to cause a light from the poles & those places from whence they come.
<93v>
Of the Sunn Stars & Plannets & Comets
Whither  move the vortex about, as Des-Cartes {will} by his beames. pag 54 Principia Philos: partis 3æ Whither the vortex can carry a Comet towards the poles &c Whence tis that the  is turned about upon his axis Whither Cartes his reflexion will unriddle the mistery of a Comets bird.
Heb 1 chap: vers 2 by God made the worlds by his son τους αιωνας      The s spots are coloured sometimes like the rainebow.
October 16 1618 in Scorpio appeared a comet the tayle being extended twixt Spica virginis & Arcturus toward the north pole it passed into libra moveing from the Ecliptick to the Tropick of cancer from east to west or Northerly
On Satturday at 30min past 4 of the clock in the morning December 17th 1664 A Comet appeared Whose distance from Sirius was 30d, 0'. from procion 38d, 45'. There was little or noe difference twixt the time of its & Sirius his self its setting about 2' after him Soe that its Right ascention was about 126d, 32'. & its declinacon Southward 31d. The length & its tayle was about 34d or 35d & pointed below toward procion or almost to the North pole, cutting the horizon at an angle of about 35 or 40d & the Ecliptick at 47d.

Whither things congeale for want of agitation from the ethereall mater. Cartes.
Whither doth air moved by light cause heate or light itselfe &c Why is a coale hoter than flame but flame heates farther Why doth warme breath proceede out of an open mouth but cold out of a contracted mouth.
Why is breath or sweate seene in winter more than in summer 
Fire heates by heating the aire because wind by blowing the aire blows heate to a man
To make a crucible to endure halfe a yeare a very strong fire lute it on the outside (thick at the bottom & thiner towards the top) with a mixture of tobaccopipe clay & salt of Tartar ( or Tartar may bee made use of but not with so good successe) I think there must bee an equall quantity of each.
Whither may not water bee frozen by drawing the warme aire from it out of Mr Boyls Receiver.
Snow put in a glasse & Salt or any quick dissolvent put into it & well mixed with it will cause vapors to settle on the outside of the glase & to freeze nay warme water or heated sand powered into the snow & well shaked together will condense vapors on the outside & perhaps congeale them. Mr Boyle
Cold ( because bodys condensed therewith moves down wards) tends farthest downwards as heat upwards.

Why does water freeze first & most next the Aire
<97r>
Of Gravity & Levity
The matter causing gravity must pass through all the pores of a body. it must ascend againe. i for else the bowells of the earth must have had large cavitys & inantys to conteine it in, 2 or else the matter must swell it. 3 the matter that hath so forcibly borne {down} the earth & all other bodys to the center (unles you will have it growne to as gross a consistance as the Earth is, & hardly then) cannot if added to gether be of a bulke so little as the earth, for it must descend exceding fast & swift as appeares by the falling of bodys, & exceeding weighty pressure to the Earth. It must ascend in another forme than it descendeth or else it would have a like force to beare bodys {illeg} that it hath to press them downe & so there would bee no gravity It must ascend in a grosser consistence than it descends because it may be slower & not strike boddys with so greate a force to impell them upward 2 that it may onely force the outside of a body & not sinke into every pore & then its densness will little availe it because it will yeild from the superficies of a body with ease to run in an easier channell as though it never strove against them. if it should ascend thinner it can have onely this advantage that it would not hit bodys with so weighty a force but then it would hit more parts of the body & would have more parts to hit with & hit with a smarter force: & so cause ascension with more force than the others could do descension. Wee know no body that {} not sinke into the pores of bodys finer than aire & it will sink into most if it be forcibly crouded in the stream descending will lay some hould on the streame ascending & so press it closer & make it denser & therefore twill rise the slower. the streame descending will grow thicker as it comes nigher to the earth but will not loose its swiftnesse untill it find a much opposition as it hath helpe from the following flood behind it. but when the streames meete on all sides in the midst of the Earth they must needs be coarcted into a narrow roome & closely press together & find very much opposition one from another so as either to turne back the same way that they came or croud through one[2]
<97v> 
Of Heate & Cold.
Apples, Eggs, Cheeses, Men &c: frozen are vitiated by freezing but not soe much when thawed by water or snow as by fire. Frost will breake stones, crack trees, make the Humor chrystall looke white.
A man cannot feele where hee is frozen & though frozen all over feeles onely a prickling in his recovery, hee may bee recovered being dipped in water or rubbed over with snow, but not by a Stove. Nay any frozen part is lost which is thawed in a Stove. & the fier pains us in warming our cold fingers. Frozen meate layd to thaw & roast by the fire will bee raw in the midst after many Howers.
Though frost change & destroy bodys (espetialy in the thawing) yet cold preserves them.
Ice (to which noe fresh aire in the Frezing could come the botome of the water being first frozen &c) is full of bubbles great as sands, shott, & pease, which bubbles are fewer & lesse if the water bee first purged of aire by the receiver. And those bubbes in thawing shrink againe perhaps into as little rome as at first.
Cold shrinkes liquors, Oyle shrinke in frezing, water scarce shrinkes before frezing, but swells before & in frezing, & Ice is about one ninth or tenth parte greater than water
Water & aire shut up in a glasse egg with a shank. the aire being in the shanke was crouded into 19 times lesse rome by the freezing of the water till it broke the glasse.
Cold will penetrate through Boyles Vacuum, Oyle of Turpentine, & a little through strong bryan & perhaps through hot mediums to freze water.
<98r>
Of violent Motion
Violent motion is continued either by the aire or by force imprest. or by the naturall gravity in the body moved. Not by the aire since the aire crowds more uppon the thing projected before, than behind, as must therefore rather hinder it for you may  observe in water that a thing moved in it doth carry the same water behind it along with it as in a cone or at least  the water is moved from behind it with but a small force as you may observe by the motes in the water supose (a) to be the boddy moved: (b. d. e. f) to be the water moving behind (a) to give it place. (r) the water behind (a) following it & going along with it. The{n} if the water at (f) ran so violently against the backsid of (a) it would beate away the water at (r) with violence but that water is moved very slowly from behind a. if it be moved away: as you may perceive by the motes in the water. the like must hapen in aire if you say no I answer must then move (a) forwards in water. So if hot leade drop into water that parte which is behind will be pointed the fore parte round which would be otherwise if the aire pressed as much on it behind as before. thirdly how can the aire continue the motion of a globe on its axis. Fourthly <98v> in the former figure the aire is supposed to have the same propensity to motion which the ball (a) is supposed to have that is will move no longer than it is propelled on. then I say the water at (r) cannot move the ball unles the ball do at the same time move (b) that (b) may (g) & (h) & (g) may move (d) & (d) move (i) & (i) move (f) & f move r & force it to rush uppon the ball & consequently at the same instant (r) must the ball, & the ball move (r) which cannot be. But suppose the aire & the ball were detained from motion by some outward agent, & yet kept the same respect to one-another in situation as they did in theire flight: then as soon as they were both let loose againe the aire would have as much power to move the ball as it had when they were in theire former flight: If it be answered that the aire will be more compressed at (f) than at (b) & consequently when let loose againe it will dilate it self & so begin a new motion. I answer how comes the aire to be more crouded behind the ball then before since (a) will communicate as much force on (b) as it receives from r & the fore parte of the aire will croud no more on the latter parts than the ball will croud on it. Againe whence is it that a peice of leade will move farther & with more force than a peice of wood of the same bignesse since the aire will have the same influence on both.

Whither the backsid of a cleare glas reflect light in vacuo
Since there is refraction in vacuo as in the aire it follows that the same subtile matter in the aire & in vacuo causeth refraction

Whither is salt or fresh water easlier {moved} & more pellucid. refracts more & easlier frozen.
Of Water & Salt
Whither fresh water consist of long bending parts & salt of stiffe & long ones. the first is false because it could never bee frozen. they would twist about one another so as they would not be fluid but onely soft. 3 they would ly too close together to admit light through them for being pliable they would fill up every corner & hence they would bee exceeding heavy. they would not refract light so well, for they would bee soft & so not firmely resist the pure matter as Glass doth & Cartes would have that matter to passe swiftlier where it findes strongest resistance & refraction to be from hence that the matter passeth swiftliest which therefore should bee in water. 5 & if it seperate it by laping about it then when it hath seperated as much as it can of one kind of Salt it could seperate no more of another which is false 6 The aire being a stubborne body (because of branchy parts) would instantly quell there circular motion when they are rarefied. Why water is clearer than vapors.
Whither burning waters & hot spirits be of small sphericall & ovall figured parts & have many such globuli as fire is of they are 1 because such are easliest seperated in distillations 2 because they are easliest agitated & so heate & enliven men 3 they must have many small & sollid attomes in them because so easly fired.
Why doth hot water first contract it selfe (viz in cooleing) & then dilate it selfe before & as it freezeth.
Why doth salt & snow freese other water. & why is heated water sooner frozen than raw water.

Whither filtration be thus caused. The aire beiing a stubborne body if it be next little pores into which it can enter it will be pressed into them (unles they be filled by something else) yet it will have some reluctance out wards like a peice of bended whale bone crouded into a hole with its middle parte forwards. if then water whose (parts are loose & pliable) have opportunity to enter that hole the aire will draw it in by strivei{ng} it selfe to get out. The aire too being continually shaken & moved in its smallest parts by vaporous particles every where tossed up & downe in it as appeares by its heate, it must needs strive to get out of all such cavity which doe hinder its agitation: & this may be the cheife reason sponges draw up water. But in paper ropes hempe threds fiddle-strings betwixt whose particles there is noe aire or but a little & it so pend up that it can scarce get out the cause may be this. that the parts of those bodys are crushed closer together than there nature will well permit & as it were bended like the laths of crosbows so that they have some reluctancy against that position & strive to get liberty which they cannot fully doe unless some oth{er} bodys come betweene them as aire or water but where aire cannot enter water will (as appeares in that it will get through a bladder which aire cannot doe &c) wherefore when opportunity offers it selfe by striving to get assunder they draw in the parts of water betwixt them

Of light see pag 82
Why light passeth easlier through white than black paper. & yet more efficaciously reflected from it.
How light is conveyed from the Sun or fire without stops.
Light is easlier admitted into black than reflected from it, for hold a paper twixt you & light with a black spot in it & it is blacker when towards you, than when to the light.
Light cannot be by pression for then wee should see in the night as wel or better than in the day we should se a bright light about us becaus we are pressed downewards . The sun would be long nay far greater. ther could be no refraction since the same matter cannot presse 2 ways, the * sun could not be quite eclipsed the Moone & planetts would shine like sunns. A man goeing or running, would see in the night. When a fire or candle is extinguish we lookeing another way should see a light. The whole East would shine in the day time & the west in the night by reason of the flood which carrys our. Vortex a light would shine from the Earth since the subtill matter tends from the center. a * little body interposed could not hinder us from seing pression could not render shapes so distinct. There is the greatest pression on that side of the earth from the  or else it would not move about in equilibrio but from the , therefore the nights should be lightest.

A ligature being tied sence & motion will be twixt the ligature & the head but not downwards. A frogs brain being peirced it looseth both sence & motion but it will leape & have its sence though its bowells bee taken out.

Of Vision
There is required some permanency in the object to perfect vison thus a coale whirled round is not like a coale but fiery circle or who can se a bullet pass by him. yet if the eye keep motion with the thing moved it sees it right One eye shutting or being perst the pupill of the other open both the eyes being opened together, dilate, & contract, & dilate. Vppon passion these spirits ebb & flow. Dymnesse may come from the deficiency of these spirits, & the Optick nerve obstructed
Rays from the same point in an object strikeing upon both the eyes do make the object seeme two as when an aye is deprest viz: then theire two axes respect not the same point, in that object. Things of the darker colour are easliest burned i.e. have loosest parts. A mans Eye struck sparkeleth.
The Eys being distorted a man may see the same parte of the same object, in two divers places with both eys at once or successively with one eye after another, & also hee may see two divers objects in the same place successively (without varying the posture of his eys or of the object, but onely by covering the one eye first & then the the other, or by being intent with one eye first & then with the other. which is an argument either that the image in the braine is painted on a superficies, or else that the Optick nerves at their meeting before they enter the braine doe sort their capilamenta uniting there each capilamentum of the one eye to its fellow capilamentum of the other eye. Soe that when the eyes conspire not towards the same object but have divers pictures painted upon the correspondent capillamenta the stronger picture at the meeting of those capillamen{ta} drownes the weaker &c:

Of Colours.
That darke colours seeme further of than light ones may be from hence that the beames loose little of theire force in reflecting from a white body because they are powerfully resisted thereby but a darke body by reason of the loosenes of its parts give some admission to the light & reflects it but weakly & so the reflection from whitenes will be sooner at the eye. or else because the whit sends beams with more force to the eye & givs it a feircer knock.
Coulors arise either from shaddows intermixed with light, or stronger & weaker reflection or [arts of the body mixed with & carried away by light.
From some of these ariseth splendor & dullnesse
A shining colour though black reflecteth an Objects rayes perfecter than dull white one as black horne black pollished leather &c better than white paper. & contrarywise. But pollished black shineth best
A window lying open to the south will bee tincted with the colour of the curtane. A paper written on put twixt the eye & the light the letters towards the light looke dim the light being refracted in the paper after its' past the inke: but the letters on this side looke perfect the light comeing streight to the eye without any refraction
Why are coles black and ashes white.
No colour will arise out of the mixture of pure black & white for then pictures drawne with inke would be coloured or printed would seeme coloured at a distance & the verges of shadows would be coloured. & lamb black & spanish whiteing would produce colours whence they cannot arise from more or lesse reflection of light or shadows mixed with light.

Of Sounds
A man may heare the beatings of his owne pulse.
In every sound the eight above it but not below it seemes to bee heard. (for there is some more subtile, some more grosse matter in the aire, & the subtilest matter is prone to quickest vibrations, though the motion of both proceede from the same cause, as the vibration of a string or pipe thus twiggs vibrate ofter than branches. Also these motions doe least check one the other & are most congruous to the string or pipes motion when the ones vibrations are double in number to the others. Hence a sound & its eight are never seperate. The greatest & grossest part of the matter in the aire doth comply with the strings motion for one string struck by the mediation of the air moves an unison string of another instrument better than that which is an Eight above or below it & the string is easliest moved by the air when its motion can be most comformable to the motion of the greatest parte of the aire. Nor can any considerable quantity of matter move slower than the string because it gives way to the strings motion & were there, yet its motion being 4 times slower than that of the subtilest matter can scarce bee perceptible. Hence each sound hath its concomitant 8th, & perhaps 15th & 22th to a good eare, above but not below it. Hence 8ths seeme to bee unisons. And violenter breathing raiseth the sound & sight or 15th not a 12th, or but seldom to a twelft.
Quære, In what proportion the sound decreaseth in its progresse from the fountaine. viz: If the sound bee (a) at the distance (b) it shall be () at the distance x.
Why doth the sound of a Bell quaver or shake like a mans voyce? Because the Bell vibrates sometimes directly somtimes obliquly towars a man

Things out of mind are remembred sometimes by meeting with other things of like nature: as dreames never thought uppon in that morning at the time of awakeing are remembred by some actions of the like nature met withall in the day time.
Forgetfullnesse ariseth sometimes out of the want of thinking of things. Things seene & words heard at the same distance are distinctly remembred. So are distance & widenes or extension & bignesse. So are things which enter not the sences as meditations, thoughts, dreames, & that a man hath remembred.
Meditations reminde a man of actions, & actions of meditatio. Colours, actions, sounds loud softly, high & low, Time as that 2 things were done together or so long after one another reconing how long since such a thing done by counting the time from one action to another untill the præsent time.
A man cannot remember what hee never thought uppon as a blow or prick or noise in his sleepe the things & sounds which hee heares & sees but minds not.

The same may be done by compareing the motions of the water of 2 weather glasses one wherof is with in a vassell of water the other not.

Of Violent motion
2 This motion is not continued by a force imprest because that force must be communicated from the mover into the moved either by Some corporeall efflux or incorporeall one or nothing. if by corporeall attomes we are still at a loss how those attomes must continue theire one motion. if by an incorporeall efflux it must be by either spirit or some quality if by a spirit how comes the spirit to be so easly united to the body & not to slip through it & when united to it how comes the spirits to cease so soone & the spirit to leave it & hence every little attome must have soules in store to cast away uppon every body they meete with. if a quality then qualitas transmigrat de subjecto in subjectum. & this quality cannot be the motion of the mover since it & the mover are seperated at once from the thing moved. In a word how can that give a power of moveing which it selfe hath not.
<113v>
Therefore it must be moved after its seperation from the mover by it one gravity. Which will be cleare by seing whither there can be motion in a vacuum & what that motion is & so compareing it with motion in pleno.
1 That there may be motion in vacuo let us suppose (a b) to be a body as a peice of Aire (c. d. e.) to be three globes, (f g h i) & all the space about the globes & that aire to be inane now in the chapter de vacuo wee have shewed that those  three globes would be really seperate & not touch one another. you will grant that halfe the globes are in places & consequently may move, suppose then that halfe of (r) in the aire move towards (d) we aske whither that part in vacuo would move along with it or stay behind & be seperated frome it if the first we have our desire if the last wee ask what should seperate it from it not the vacuum since that is accounted nothing. but you may say that it is not truly motion for the upper parte of r to be carried to (d) we answer that where there is action (for such is the passing of (r) to (d)) & where there are new respects acquired to the same bodys there must be motion, but the upper part of (r) hath neither the same respect to the aire nor to (d) which it had before it began to pass towards d. If this going of r to d be not motion I aske what it is. but this is onely to strive about termes & if it please you not to call it motion cal <114r> it what you will but it is that which we aimed to prove & there is but this difference twixt it & motion in pleno. that the one is environed with such mater as is impenitrable & consequently that mater must be crouded out of the moving bodys way before or rather at the same time that the body moves, it must needs impede the motion to be continually thrusting against & resisted by the body before it: but in vacuo it meetes with nothing impenitrable to stay it tis true God is as far as vacuum extends but he being a spirit & penetrating all matter can be no obstacle to the motion of matter noe more than if nothing were in its way Let mee aske why one should be motion more than another since in pleno motion is so stopped by one body rubbing uppon another & in vacuum it hath its liberty can the same thing (viz a being invironed with bodys) at the same give a being to motion & yet destroy it, wherefore to be in pleno cannot be essentiall to motion. & if it were things would be more properly sade to move where there is most body or they find most resistance to theire motion & so more properly in water than in aire &c. But it is objected by Aristotle that a Vacuum is uniforme & every where alike & a body hath the same respects to a vacuum in all places alike but there is no motion with some mutation of circumstances And so in Vacuo no motion I answer as to our senses the aire is uniforme And we judge a thing to be moved when we se it come nigher or goe farther from some thing which our senses can perceive & so we judge not a thing to be moved in respect of the aire but of the earth or some thing

The motion of the comet
from 2day to 11th day 26d 31'. From 11th to 13th; 6d 34' from 13th to 14th 2d 35' 50". from 13th day to 24th it moved 23degr 45' 54". The 1st day the tayle was avers from  exactly its tayle reached beyond |  below the {illeg} <115r> lower wheeles in the Great Beares belly & was in a manner  to them. But it declined a little afterwards from  toward  upwards Sometimes the tayle declines from  20 or 30 degres east or westward. The tayle of this last Comet was sometimes 25d in length. The beard of it was so raire as that starrs might be seene through it.
1664. Dec 9th old stile at 4 of the clock in the Morning the latitude southward of the Comet was 20d, its longit 182d. The length of its tayle 20d.
On fryday before midnight December 23d 1664 I observed a Comet whose rays were round her, yet her tayle extended it selfe a little towards the east parallell to the Ecliptick The  it selfe was not seene onely it looked like a little cloude The altitude of Sirius at the time of observation was 16d, The comet was then entering into the whales mouth at the nether jaw being distant from Aldeboran 23d 21' & as much from Rigel. Therefore the longitude of it was 48d 4'. its latitude 22d, 3', 44". At about 9h 24' at night  
December 24th it appeared as on the day before, being distant from Rigel 28d, 24'; from Aldeb: 24d 12{'} Sirius being 20d high that is it was 10h 28' |  26' at night. whence its longitude was 44d 7' its latitude southward 18d 23'.  
Dec 27th before midnight Sirius being 16d high the distance of the Comet from Aldeboran was 28d 11'. from Rigel 38d 36' . Its longitude was 37d. 4'. 13". <115v> its longitude was 37d, 4', 13". its latitude south 10d, 20', 4{illeg}{"} at 9h 8' at night.
The length of its tayle was about 11d being extended towards Aldeboran or a little below it parallell to the Ecliptick. The tayle now perfectly manifested it selfe on that east side . It moved northward against the streame of the Vortex cutting it at an angle of about 45d or 46d. There was stil a very bright beard |  haire round about the Comet & it seemed to bee nothing but bird raying from the center of it for I could not see the limits of the .  
Dec 28th the comet was distant from the bright p in the jaw of the Whaile 5d 52'. from the {middle} star q in the Whailes mouth 3d 43'. Covering the   twixt e the 3d & 5t of the Goate with its haire but being rather above it as in the figure. Its tayle extending to the 3d & 4th stars in the section of the bull  
Dec: 29th when 'twas in the meridian its altitude was 44d 13'. Therefore its declinacion was 6d 30' Northward. 
Dec: 30th, 15min past 7h at night. The right ascention of the Comet was the same with the  c below the whailes eye its declinacon about 28' most northern
<116r>
Ian 1st Sirius being 20d 50' high, or 21d high The comet had 4' in Alinicanthers more than the  below the whailes eye, 5' in Azimuths westward more than that in the hinder parte of the head. Its tayle being 12d in length & extending towards the 3 s below Suculæ under Aldeboran.
Ian 2d Aldebor being Ian 2d Rigells Altitude being 25d 30' or lesse The Comet had the same Azimuth with the  in the hinder parte in the Whailes head, being perpendicularly over it & distant from it 2d 41'.
On Tuesday Ian 10th at 10 of the clock at night The comet was distant from the northerne  following the 1st  of  6d 10'. from the midle & brighter  in the north knot of the fishes 6d 8'. Its tayle poynting towards the biggest of the 3 s in the taile of  but being very weake & the star it selfe grown very dim.
On Munday Ian 23d at 8h at night The Comet was distant from the middle bright  in the North knot of the  3d 58'. & twixt that  & the  in the Rams neck exactly. its tayle being scarse discernable. This comets motion was swiftest & it nerest to us when it was in the belly of Syrius its right ascention being 100d.

On Satturday Aprill 1st 1665 There appeared anothe{r} Comet which at 20' after 3 in the morning was distant from the Head of Andromeda 3d 29'. & From the  in the left knee of Pegasus 16d, 18'. being in or very neare the Tropick with longitude  4d or thereabouts by the Globe.
On Tuesday morning at 20' after 3 Apr: 4th the Come{t} was distant from Andromeda's head, 8d, 26'. From the Star in Cassiopeas Brest called Schedir 28d 22'. Being on that side of them towards Perseus. 
On wednesday apr 5th at 20m after 3h the Comet was distant from the head of Andromeda 10d 40'. 28d. 58' from Cassiopeas brest.

The gravity of a body in divers places as at the top & bottome of a hill; in different latitudes &c: may bee measured by an instrument of this forme 
The weight of water is to the weight of quicsilver as 1 to 14. Water is 400 (perhaps 2000) times heavier than aire & gold 19 times heavier than water.  
Quæst: What proportion the weights of two bodys as gold & silver have in divers mediums as in vacuo aere aqua &c: which known the weight of the aire or water in vacuo or the quantity of gold to the silver is given &c: As if in aire the Gold (a) is equiponderant to the silver (z) the weight {a} it being called b. And in water the gold (a) is equiponderant to the silver (2z). let (c) bee the weight of so much water in the aire as is equall to the Gold a then is  the weight of so much water as is equall to the silver . Then the gold & silver weighed in water their weights are diminished by the weight of the water whose place they conteine. Therefor b - c is the weight of the gold a in the water & b -  is the weight of the silver (z) in it, & since b is equiponderant to 2z in it Therefore b - c = 2b -2  or  = z. that is 2c : b + c :: a : z. Or if (c) the weight of water in the aire is sought then  = c. Thus might the absolute weights of bodys i: e: their weights in vacuo bee found. as of air or the Bodys or fire in a hot furnace without flame {&c}

 In the descention of a body There is to be considered the force which it receives every moment from its gravity (which must be least in a swiftest body) & the opposition it receives from the aire (which increaseth in proportion to its swiftnesse).

But it will bee best to fix the wheele & make the armes cd & ac very long especially cd. This balance may bee of excellent use for finding the severall weights of allayed or mint bodys by their weight in severall mediums as in aire & water(as of gold & coppor,) or to compare the quantity of any two bodys (as gold & stone) by their difference of weight in divers mediums. to compare the weights of bodys, viz to find what proportion the weights of those bodys would have were they equall.
Try whither the weight of a body may be altered by heate or cold, by dilatation or condensition, beating , poudering, transfering to severall places or severall heights or placing a hot or heavy body over it or under it or by magnetisme whither leade or its dust spread abroade, whither a plate flat ways or edg ways in heaviest, whither the rays of gravity may bee stopped by refecting or refracting them, if so a perpetuall motion may bee made one of these two ways

The more uniformely the globuli move the optick nerves the more bodys seme to be coloured red yellow blew greene &c but the more variously they move them the more bodys appeare white black or Greys.
<122v>
1 Note that slowly moved rays are refracted more then swift ones
2dly If adbc be shaddow & cdsr white then the slowly moved rays coming from cdqp will be refracted as if they had come from eodc soe that the slowly moved rays being seperated from the swift ones by refraction, there ariset 2 kinds of colours viz: from the slow ones blew, sky colour, & purples. from the swift ones red, yellow            & from them which are neither moved very swift nor slow ariseth greene but from the slow & swiftly moved rays mingled ariseth white grey & black. whence it is that cdqp will not appeare red unless qsrp be darke because as many slow rays as come from cdqp & are refracted as if they came from eodc, soe many slow rays come from qsrp & are refracted as if they came from dqpc unless qsrp be darker than dqpc
3dly That the rays which make blew are refracted more than the rays which make red appeares from this experiment If one hafe of the thred abc be blew & the other red  & a shade or black body be put behind it then lookeing on the thred through a prism one halfe of the thred shall appeare higher than the other & not both in one direct line, by reason of unequall refractions in the 2 differing colours.
4 Hence rednes yellownes &c are made in bodys by stoping the slowly moved rays without much hindering of the motion of the swifter rays. & blew greene & purple by diminishing the motion of the swifter rays & not of the slower. Or in some bodys all these colours may arise by diminishing the motion of all the rays in greater or lesse geometricall proportion, for then there will be lesse difference in theire motions than otherwise
<123r>
5 If the particles in a body have not so greate an elastick power as to returne back the whole motion of a ray. then that body may be lighter or darker colored according as the elastick virtue of that bodys parts is more or lesse.
6 If there be loose particles in the pores of a body which by makeing them very narrow or by otherwise hindering the elastick power of the subtil matter whereby the motions of the rays are conserved that body may have some colour, &c 
7 If a pore be too much straitned as at c e, so that the globulus must part the matter towards b from the matter towards d so that ther be no subtil matter on either side towards c or e, when some of that narrow pore is behind it, there will be noe matter on either side it to presse it towards its hinder parts so much as it is pressed before likewise it is forced to croude before it all the matter in the pore so that its motion must needes be diminished if it had force to passe through but if it had not force enough to part the matter & get through then it would be reflected back without looseing any considerable parts of its motion as rays passing out of glass, into the aire when their force is too much diminished by their obliquity they are reflected by the aire without any loss of their motion & bodys full of such straight passages in its pores must be of darke colours as blew glass whose pores may be straightned by loose & too greate particles of the tincture lying within them. But if this pore were something bigger so as to let the slowly moved ○s passe through with losse of most or all theire motion, but letting the swift ones scape freelier then the colour will be red, yellow &c: as in glasse it <123v> may be whose poores are full of smaller particles of the tincture than those pores of blew glasse are,
8 Though 2 rays be equally swift yet if one ray be lesse than the other that ray shall have so much {illeg} lesse effect on the sensorium as it has lesse motion than the other &c.
Whence supposeing that there are {loos} particles in the pores of a body bearing proportion to the greater rays, as 9 : 12: & the less globulus is in proportion to the greater as 2 : 9. the greater globulus by impinging on such a particle will loose a  partes of its motion the less glob: will loose  parts of its motion & the remaining motion of the glob: will have almost such a proportion to one another as {illeg} in quantity have. viz.  :  :: 9: 1 which is almost 2 {the less} glob. & such a body may {proove blew} & {purple}
But if the particles on which the globuli reflect are equall to the less globulus it shall loose its motion & the greater glob: shall loos  parts of its motion & such a body may be red or yellow
 9 If I presse my eye on the left side (when I looke towards my right hand) as at a, then I see a circle of red as at c but within the red is blew for the capillamenta are more pressed at n & o & round about the finger then at a towards the midst of the finger. that parte of the apparition at q is more languid because the capillamenta at o are duller & if the finger move towards e two much it vanisheth at q & appeareth semicircular but if I put my finger at e or {b} the apparition wholly vanisheth. By puting a brasse plate betwixt my eye & the bone nigher to the midst of the {tunica} than I could put my finger I mad a very vivid impression <124r> But of an ellipticall figue because the edge of the plate with which I prest my eye was long & not round like my finger If I was in the darke & the impression be very strong towards the outside appeared a broade circle of purple next blew then greene then yellow, red like flame, yellow, greene, blew, purple which growing from a very darke by degrees to a lighte blew ends in a greene in the midst. The colours I suppose next the flameing red looke something the darker by reason of its splendor. And if the experiment bee done in the light so that though my eyes were shut yet some rays got through my eye lids the outmost purple would appeare of a colour inclining to blacknes by reason I suppose of the bordering light. also if the pressure was not very strong the greene & purple at a would not be preceived in the darke but it would be something lighter in the light than in other places of the eye as at v or w, & all the other outmost colours without strong pression bee but blew. but if the presion be strong in the light the apparition will but little vary from what it is in the darke. beyond all the colours as betweene o & e the light is stronger than in other places as at v or w, because the pressure helpes the motion from without but is not strong enough to turne it to colour
10 Heate a peice of steele glowing hot, hold it over some water untill it turne from a white to a red heate then immediately quench it so far as you would harden for if it be quenched sooner it will bee too brittle if later too soft. Then makeing the end bright hold it over a candle that the end may be halfe an inch out of the flame, or lay it upon a hot iron, & these colours will follow one another towards the end of it; viz: bright yellow, deeper & reddish yellow or sanguine, a fainter blew; & a deeper blew, If it be quenched in tallow when tis yellow tis fit for gravers, drills &c: If when the light blew is on it it is fit for springs for watches If when the deepe blew is on it, it will bee very soft.

11 The colours succede in order according to theire more or lesse reflection of light viz: white, redd, yellow, blew, purple greene, black. Red, & purple paint theire colours far more manifestly than blew, or greene.
Light reflected from a yellow to a blew body makes a greene
12 The sunne shineing through coloured paper or glasses as also the mixture of divers colours exhibits these colours viz yellow & blew make red
Yellow & red make Orange colour. Purple & red make scarle{t} Red & greene a darke orange Tauny. Red & blew make purple. Red & white by mixture make a Carnation
12 the yellow colour (made by a prisme) falling upon a blew makes a greene. blew falling upon red mak{es} a greene. It would be tried what colours the mixture of colours falling from 2 prismes would make.

14 Motes in the sunne in some positions appeare of divers colors.
15 Put as much common Sublimate into hot faire water as it can dissolve filter the solution through cap paper that it may be lympid. & into 2 spoonefulls of it, put about 5 drops of good limpid spirits of urine & it will be white like milke, to which if you put in some rectified Aqua=fortis it will be transparent. more fresh spirit of urine will make it looke white but not so white as before,
16 Make a strong Infusion of broken galls in faire water filter it into a cleane violl ad more of the same liquor to it till it be transparent. into it shake a convenient quantity of cleare but very strong solution of vitrioll & it will be black, then drop a little cleare & strong oyle of vitrioll into it shakeing the vessell well & the liquor will become transpar{ent} which againe will become black by the affusion of a smal{l} quantity of a strong solution of salt of tartar.
Note, the Corrosive liquors ( as oyle of Vitrioll) may clari{fy} a liquor seperating & dividing its parts. But precipitating liquors (as salt of tartar) by uniteing theire parts make them conspicuous & the liquor coloured.

[9]Of Imagination
I gather that my Phantasie & the  had the same operation uppon the spirits in my optick nerve & that the same motions are caused in my braines by both.
Opening my eye & lookeing in the darke upon the like imaginations there appeared the like phantasme as when I shut it
5 Lookeing uppon white paper there appeared (by meanes of a strong phantasie) first a spot something darker than the paper which grew blacker & blacker until there seemed to be a dusky red spreading almost over all the paper {sometime} this spot would be red & sometime blew
6 lookeing on a bright cloude there appeared the same phantasm as when I looked on the white paper onely for the most part blacker untill at last I was able to make this spot glitter amidst the dusky red whither I looke on the paper or cloude like the  in a cloude so bright that my eys watered.
7 Imploying my selfe in other exercises for two or 3 howers an hower before  set hee being wholy clouded, when I thought my eye was prety well restored I repeated all the former experiment adding this to them that though I shut the distemperd eye & opened that with which I looked not on the  that I could see the  pictured on the cloudes or other white objects almost as plaine as if I had looked with my distempered eye the other being shut & every where about  appeared a dusky red & blacknesse. & with doeing thus I have made such impress on the optick nerve that let me looke with which eye I would  offered itselfe to my vew unless I set my fantasie to worke on other things which with much difficulty I could doe

10 When I had beene thus affected 2 days the same white wall If I looked not over nigh it where it was shadowed looked blew, where it was lesse shadowed looked red inclining to white where it was lightest by the rays of the  reflected from a wall uppon it it looked white, at that time I had beene in a darke rome for 2 or 3 howers & my eyes were made tender thereby so the motion made in them would be easlier conserved & consequently more uniforme.

Of the Creation .
The word ברא which Gen i.i. is interpreted to create something out of nothing is used Gen the 1st v.21 where tis saide God created greate Whales &c, but the matter out of which they were created did exist before neither is it ment of creating the soule or forme of the whale, for that is not the whale alone. & there may be but one kind of irrationall soule which joyned with severall kinds of bodys make severall kinds of beasts, for setting aside the different shape of theire body beasts differ from one another but in some qualitys which are called instincts of nature. now as in men whose soules are of one kind some love hate feare &c one thing some another & few men are of the same temper which diversity arises from theire bodys (for all theire soules are alike) so why may not the severall tempers or instincts of divers kinds of beasts arise from the different tempers & modes of theie bodys they differing from one another more than one mans body from anothers.. To suppose then that God did create divers kind of soules for divers kinds of beasts is to suppose God did more than He needed How then can the soule of the whale be called the whalle since before it be joyned with the whale tis as much the soule of a horse & this creating then of whales & severall other creatures must be noe but modifying matter into the body of a whale & infusi{ng} an irrationall soule into it. Eccles: 33 ves 10 Adam was created of the earth.
Whither Moses his saying Gen the 1st that the evening & the morning were the first day &c do prove that God created time. Coll 1.16 or heb 1 ch 2 v τους ἀιωνας ἐποίησεν expounded, he made the worlds. prove that God created time

Of the soule
Were the soule nothing but modified matter & did memory consist in action (for it can thus consist in nothing else) wee could never call things into our memory for so long as that action continews we must thinke of & remember that phantasme & when that action ceaseth & not before then wee may cease to thinke & remember that phantasme but how shall we call this thing into memory the action being done & we haveing no principle with in us to begin such a motion againe within us. &c
If sence consisted in reaction we should perceive things double or we should never se any thing before us but there would be some apparition behind us for let this perceiving body be what it will supose the conarion it cannot be so much pressed on one side by the spirits but it will press upon the spirits on the other side as consequently they will presse upon it &c.
Hobbs. part 4th chap 1st. Motion is never the weake{r} for the object being take away for then dreames would not be so cleare as sence. but to men wakeing things past appeare ob={scurer} then things present because the organs being moved by other present objects at the same time those phantasmes are lesse predominant. Resp: Then we should never forget any thing. 2 Phantasmes are prædominant from the strenght of the motion causing them if then but if the motion causing present & past phantasmes be alike strong the effect must be equall & so there would be no difference betwix sence & phantasie. all things which wee ever perceived would be alike in our phantasie & wee should thinke of an immense multitude of objects at once. &c
<130v>
Of the soule
Memory is a faculty of the soule (in some measure for else how can divers sounds, or words excite her to divers thoughts or 3. 4. 5 or more words beget the same thought in her. Perhaps shee remembers by the helpe of characters in the Braine, but then how doth shee remember the signification of those characters.
Quaere. 1 Why Objects appeare not inverst, Resp: The mind or Soule cannot judge the image in the Braine to be inversed unlesse shee perceived externall things with which shee might compare that Image.
2. Why doe appeare to bee without our body? Resp: Because in the image of things delineated in the braine by sight, the bodys image is placed in the midst of the images of other things, is moved at our command {towars} & from those other images. &c :
3. But why are not these objects then judged to bee in the braine Resp: Because the image of the braine is not painted there, nor is the Braine perceived by the soule it not being in motion, & probably the soule perceives noe bodys but by the helpe of their motion. But were the Braine perceived together with those images in it wee should thinke wee saw a body like the braine encompasing & comprehending our selves the starrs & all other visible objects. &c
<131r>
Of Quantity
If Extension is indefinite onely in greatness & not infinite then a point is but indefinitely little & yet we cannot comprehend any thing lesse. To say that extension is but indefinite (I meane all the extension which exists & not soe much onely as we can fansy) because we cannot perceive its limits, is as much as to say God is but indefinitely perfect because wee canot apprehend His whole perfection
<132r>
Of Sleepe & Dreames &c
How is it that the Soule so often remembers her dreames by chanch otherwise not knowing shee had dreamed, & thence whither she by perpetually employed in sleepe. whither dreames are of the body or soule. Why are they patched up of many fragments & incoherent passages.

Of colours vide pag 69
17 Substances belonging to the vegetable or Animall Kingdome when lightly burned are black, when througly burned are white. As Ivory being skilfully burnt affords painters one of the deepest blacks they have &c. But mineralls are to bee excepted from this rule, For Alabaster if never so much burnt will turne no darker then yellow. Leade being calcined with a strong fire turnes into minium which is red, & this minium by burning turnes darker but never to a white colour. Blew, but unsophisticated Vitriol when tis burnt a little by a slow heate to friability, is white being further burnt turnes Grey, Yellow, red, & when perustum it turnes to a purple.
18 Take Rectified oyle of Vitriol mixt by degrees with a convenient quantity of the essentiall oyle of wormewood (which was drawne over with stove of water in a limbec) & warily distill the mixture in a retort, there will bee left behind a greate quantity of dry & very black matter
Or becaus the essentiall oyle of Winter-savory is clearer than that of wormewood mix it by degrees with about an equall quantity of oyle of Vitrioll these two cleare liquors distilled as before leave a good quantity of black matter.
19 Gold & silver melted into a lumpe & dissolved by Aqua fortis the pouder of gold falling to the bottome appeares not yellow but black though neither the gold silver nor Aquafortis be so, & silver rubbed on other bodys colours them black.
20 Most bodys precipitated from the liquor into which they were dissolved are white, but not all.
21 The scrapeings of black horne lookes white.
22 Sulphur adust is not the cause of blacknesse as Chimists hold, for common sulphur be either melted or sublimed turnes onely red or yellow. And the plant Camphire though very inflamable & consequently sulphureous by burning turnes to noe colour but white &c. But then what causeth blackness in sulphur adust.
23 A Candle looked on through blew glasse appeares greene.
24 Pouder of blew bise mixed with a greater quality of yellow orpiment makes a greene but the particles by a microscope are discovered to retaine theire blewness & yellownesse.
25 The steame of clear Aq: Fortis, or spirit of niter is red, &c.

26. A feather or black ribband put twixt my eye & the setting sunne makes glorious colours.
27 An Acid Spirit & juice & salts as Spirit of salt, or of Vinegar, or of Vitriol or Lemmon juice, or Oyle of Vitrioll, or Aqua fortis   being droped into diversly coloured liquors & especiall{y} blew ones (as syrrup of violets impregnated with the tincture of the flowers, juice of blew bottles or coneweede, juice of ripe privet berrys,          ) it turnes them commnly to a red colour. But sulphureous salts which are either Vrinous & volatile salts of Animall substances (as Spirit of Hartshorne, of Vrine, of blood, of Sal=Armoniack                               ) or Lixiviate Vnctuous or Alcalizate & fixed Salts made by incineration (as the solution of Salt of Tartar, of pot ashes, of common wood ashes, of lime=water, Oyle of Tartar,                     ) doe change them to a Greene. as the red juice of bucthorne berrys
28 Yet either a Lixivious liquor, or urinous salt being poured on a solution of blew vitrioll in faire water makes it yellow & the precipitated corpuscles retained the yellow colour when they were falne to the bottome.
29 A just quantity of Oyle of Tartar poured into a strong solution of french verdigrease turnes it from greene to blew; a Lixivium of pot ashes turnes it to a lighter blew, & spirit of Vrin, or Harts-horne make other blews.
30 {One graine} of Cochineel dissolved in spirits of urin & then by degrees in faire water, imparted a discernable colour to 125000 graines of faire water.
31 Most of the Tinctures which chimists draw which abound with minerall or Vegetable Sulphur turne red; & both Acid & Alcalizate salts in most sulphureous or oyly bodys produce a red. & blew is more commonly turned to red than red to blew
32 Fully satiate good common sublimate with water filter it through paper that it be cleare, put a spoonfull of it into a cleare glasse drop in 3 or 4 drops of oyle of tartar well filtred & it will be of an Orange colour. but 4 or 5 drops of oyle of Vitriol dispersed about the glasse by shaking it, makes the liquor pellucid againe
<134r>
32 Some tinctures (as that of Amber made with Spirits of wine) appeare red or yellow as the vessells they fill are slender or broade but cochineel dissolved as before, & other liquors never looke otherwise than Red or of a carnation &c.
33 White bodys are commonly sulphureous.
34 Oyle of Tartar generally precipitates Metalline bodys corroded with acid salts.
35 Tinge water with red rose leaves into which drop a little Minium disolved in spirit of vinegar & it will be of a muddy greene, but drop in a little Oyle of Vitrioll which though an acid Menstruum yet it will præcipitate the leade in the forme of a white pouder to the bottome leaving the rest of the liquor above of a good red almost like a Rubie
36 Oyle or spirit of Turpentine will not mix with water & it & water shaken together apeare white.
37 Some very corrosive & acid liquors will præcipite some others, as oyle of Vitrioll præcipitates divers bodys dissolved in Aqua fortis or spirit of wine vinegar, which precipitated bodys are usually very white
38 Bodys will scarcely be precipitated by Alcalizate salts that are not first dissolved in acid Menstruums
39 A leafe of Gold held betwixt the eye & the light appeares blew.
40 Acid salts rather dilute yellow & white juice than turn them to red,
41 Gentle heates in chimicall operations rather produce rednesse than other colours in digested menstruums not onely sulphureous (as spirit of wine) vid: sec: 31. but saline as Spirit of Vinegar
42 Alcalizite salts are wont to precipitate what acid salts dissolve
43 An Acid salt doth seldom restore a Vegitable substance to the colour of which an Alcalazite deprived it.
44 The acidity of spirit of vinegar is destroyed by working on Minium, (or perhaps on Crabs claws)
45 Put some solution of Minium into a spoonefull of the fresh tincture of logwood to turne it deeply purple <134v> precipitate  the leade with spirit of sal=armonick which precipitacion as well as the supernatant liquor looks purple (by reason of the predominance of the tinged particles over the white) then power in some spirit of salt warily & the precip{:} by Sal=Ar: is of a violet colour at the botome, the precip{:} by spirit of salt is white & carnacon in the midst, & the top yellow or red.     vide sec 35
46 That the colour of a body bee altered by a cleare liquor tis commonly required that it have salt yet faire water powred on the grey & friable calix of powdred Vitriol melted by a gentle heate till it colour change & the liquor being set by in a close violl for some days it will tune to a vitriolate colour
47 Take Lignum Nephriticum (the infusion of which in faire water is good against the stone of the kidneys) put a handfull of thin slices of it into 3 or 4 pound of pure spring water after it hath infused there a night put the water into a cleare violl, & if you see the light through it it appeares of a golden colour (excepting sometimes a sky coloured circle at the top) but if the infusion was too strong the liquor will then appeare darke & reddish. But if your eye is twixt the liquor & light it appeares ceruleous: & Acid salts destroy the blew colour & sulphureous saltes restore it againe, without making any change in the golden colour. Which may bee usefull to the finding whither bodys abound more with acid or sulphureous Salts.
48 The same may be done by Sirrup of Violets impregnated with the tinture of the flowers. For an acid salt turnes it from blew to red but sulphureous one from blew to greene. vide sec 27.
49 Haveing found that a sulphureous salt is predominant in a body it may be knowne whither that salt be Vrinous (i. e. volatile salts of anim{al} <135r> or other substances which are contrary to acid ones) or Alcalizate in the 32d sec. that is into sublimate disolved in faire water put an Alcaly & it turnes it to an Orange Tauny, but urinous (or salsuginous) salts turne it to a pure white
50 the same liquor viz oyle of Vitriol) powred into a lixivium in which crude antimony has beene newly boyled turnes it from a cleare to a yellow colour, which sec: 32 turned a yellow to a cleare one.
51 There be flat peices of a certaine kind of glase which exhibits the Phenominon of lignum Nephriticum.

Note that the 3d 4th 5th & other figures are found by the same manner that the seacond figure is found onely makeing all the figures found to stand for A the first side & the figure sought for e or the 2d side
And if roote is found inexpressible in whole numbers then adding ciphers & pointing them from the unite towards the right {kind} as was before explained & soe hold on the worke in decimalls.
As for the Divisors they are easily found by the 2d Table of Powers from a Binomial roote.
If the Number bee of 6.7.8.9.10 &c dimensions The roote may be extracted after the same manner

Of the Extraction of Rootes in Affected powers.
The manner of the extraction of rootes in pure & affected powers is very much alike, especially when the affected powers are decently prepared, that is, when theire affections are not over large & those altogether either affirmative or negative, & the power affirmative, affirmations & negations so mixt that there be noe ambiguity & all fractions & Asymmetry taken away
All the figures in the coefficients & affected power are to be pointed (after the manner before explained in the Analisis of pure powers) according to the degree of theire dimensions & the worke onely differs from that in pure powers in that the coefficients enter into the divisors
Let the first side be called A. the 2d be called E. the Roote of the equation {L} the coefficients   &c the Power  &c & the Operation follows 
The analysis of Cubick Equations.
The equation supposed .    
<4v>
 
But the Coëfficient maybe greater than the Power soe that it cannot be substracted from it which argues that the Cube more propperly affects than is affected. In this case the coëfficient must descend towards the unite soe many points untill it may be substracted, & soe many points as the coëfficient is devolved soe many pricks must be blotted out towards the left hand in the power affected. As the Example shews   . 
 
<5r>
To place the unite of the coefficient in its right place in respect of the power make so many pricks above as there are under the power begining at the unit, & if the coefficient be one dimension lesse than the power make a prick on every figure if 2 dimensions les than every other figure of 3 dimensions lesse make it one each third figure &c
If there be many coefficients in the equation each must be placed according to this rule.
Sometimes the coefficient is under a negative sine as  & the Analysis is as follows
 
But sometimes the square coëfficient hath more paires of figures than the cube to be analysed, hath & then there is præfixing so many ciphers to the cube as figures are wanting, the first side will not much differ from the square roote of the coefficient. as  

<5v>
 
Sometimes though there be as many 2 figures in the coefficient as 3 figures in the cube affected yet the coëfficient may be so greate as to deceive an unwary Analist As in this . where the roote of  is  which cubed is  which added to  makes  then whose roote the number immediately greater is  which is the first side . 
But if the coefficient had beene affirmative, then not the aggregate of the facts but the difference must be taken as in this. . 
Since the roote of  is . which cubed is . &  . the roote of which is . The like is observable in equations of higher powers
If the Cube be affected with a negative sine as . Then the Equation is expressible of 2 rootes: whereof the square of one is <6r> lesse & the square of the other is greater then . & therefore one roote is lesse the other greater then . & in this equation  are two rootes whereof one is greater the other lesse then .

Suppose in the former cubick equation the lesse roote be 12. then . or else . & . where  is the greater roote.

July 4th 1699. By consulting an accompt of my expenses at Cambridge in the years 1663 & 1664 I find that in the year 1664 a little before Christmas I being then Senior Sophister, I bought Schooten's Miscellanies & Cartes's Geometry (having read this Geometry & Oughtred's Clavis above half a year before) & borrowed Wallis's works & by consequence made these Annotations out of Schooten & Wallis in winter between the years 1664 & 1665. At which time I found the method of Infinite series. And in summer 1665 being forced from Cambridge by the Plague I computed the area of the Hyperbola at Boothby in Lincolnshire to two & fifty figures by the same method.                 Is. Newton

Now suppose the line  be divided into an infinite number of equall parts  &c, from each of which are drawne parallels   &c. which increase continually in some of the foregoeing progressions or in some progression compounded of them, all those lines may be taken for the surface  , & to know what proportion that superficies hath to the superficies  that is what proportion all those lines have to soe may equal to the greatest of them, I say as the index of the progression increased by an unite is to an unite soe is the square  to the area of the crooked line. As if  is a parabola the lines  &c are a subsecundanary series (for ) whose index is  which added to an unite is  Therefore  so is the square  to the area of the Parab. (the names of the lines are   &c  .  &c  . . .) The case is the same if  bee supposed a sollid, as suppose it a Parabolicall conoides. then since the nature of it is .  designes the squares  &c: all which taken together are equivalent to the Sollid. & those squares increase in the same proportion which . or  doth. that is they are a primanary series whose index is  to which (according to the rule I ad an unite & tis .

Also if a superficies be compounded of 2 or more of these series, Their area is as easily found as if the nature of the line bee ,  , or  or . &c. Their areas will bee to the parallelograms {about} them as  to  , as  to  , as  to  &c. but if I put in the intermediate termes in these last named lines their order will bee , , , . . ; &c: & since these lines observe a geometricall progression their areas must observe some kind of progression. of which every other terme is given viz . Twixt which termes if the intermediate termes  can bee found the 2nd square will give the area of the line , the circle. Soe likewise in this progression of lines   .   .  .  &c: the progression of their areas is   &c. the 2nd if it can bee found gives the area of the circle for as its denominator to its numerator so is the square of the diameter to the area of a semicircle. If this last progression bee multiplyed by the respective termes in the progression  & it may bee diminished the result being  soe that in this progression  &c: if <16v>  can be found then, the square of the diameter to the area of the circle is as the denominator of  to its numerator. Likewise the 1st series of areas may be diminished by multiplying each terme by its correspondent terme in this progression  &c: & it will become,  . &c. In which if  can bee found then as the denominator of  to its numerator: so the square of the Radius is a semicircle, that making the radius  . . The same kinds of changes may bee performed by any other progressions, as by division by the geometricall progression  & the first series of areas becomes  &c viz the same with the 2d series. Also these changes may be done by addition or substraction of mutuall termes in 2 proportions. Soe that the most convenient way may be chosen, wherby to reduce any series of proportions to the most convenient forme.
Now if it be propounded to find these middle termes, It will bee convenient to find how the given proportion may bee deduced from an Arithmeticall, Geometricall, or some other familiar proportion, viz whose meane termes may be found, as this progression  deduceth its originall from this   & in which  is an infinite number .
It will also be convenient to find what relation all the other meanes have to the first soe that if the first bee had all the other may bee deduced thence. As in this case suppose the 1st meane to bee  . The progression will bee <17r>  deducing its originall from  & from this . &c {+} (note that the proportions of these meane termes to one another, or to , are found by finding the proportion of the circle  to the line  &c).

Dr Wallis in a letter to Sr Kenelme Digby teacheth how to find the center of gravity in divers lines first when their position is as in  this figure.
Suppose  the Axis,  their vertex Then saying, as  to the index of the line increased by an unite (vide pag 2dam) so  to  Then  is their center of gravity.
The Demonstration.
Let  bee the index of the series according to which the odinately aplyed lines (parallell to ) increase, then  area of the line  to  . the distances of those ordinate lines from the vertex  are equall to the intercepted diameters & therefore a primanary series (whos index is . & since supposing  the center of the ballance the whole weight of the surface or figure is composed of its magnitude & distance from the center and therefore the index of all its moments or whole weight is , viz: the aggregate of the other two. Therefore as all its moments (or the weight of the figure in its site in respect of the center  are to soe many of the greatest (or to the weight of the rectangle  hung on the point ) soe is , to . and if , then  hung on the point  shall counterballance the figure in its site &c therefore if ,  shall be the center of gravity of those figures.

Also as the figure is now put extending infinitely towards  if { }.  being the center of  then  shall bee the center of gravity of the whole figure  .
Demonstration
<24v>
since the lines parallell to  increase in series reciprocally proportionall their index is  & since the halfes of those lines increase in the same proportion their index is . whose extremitys or middle points of the whole lines (suposing  the center of the ballance) are theire centers of gravity, their distances from  being proportionall to the lines whose centers they are & consequently their index is  & since all the moments (or whole weight of the figure) increase in a proportion compounded of the proportion of the magnitudes & distances of the lines from the center , they will be in a duplicate proportion of the lines magnitudes that is a reciprocall series whose index is . Therefore the figure is to the inscribed parallelogram as  to . & all its moments or whole weight in this its site to the weight of the parallelogram as  to . Therefore if, , the parallelogram hanging on the point  shall counterballanc{e} the whole figure in its site &c: whence the point  may be found easily, viz .

 Soe if the glass  bee fastened upon the mandrill , it may be ground acording to the sollid figure  by the helpe of a stick of steele (as a cone) whose cuspis is in the hole  upon which it is moved as on a center. when the cone  leanes uppon the vertices of  &  it must be perpendicular to the mandrill . Perhaps it may be convenient to cause the cone  to turne about its axis. Or it may bee better instead of the nutt at  with a hole in it to make a sharpe pointed nutt, & instead of the cone  to make use of a broad plate to cover ,  &  & move every way upon them
<30r>
Another way to describe lines on plates

Suppose the plate bee , whose edge  is to be made into the fashion of a given crooked line suppose  is its vertex & that a circle described with the Radius  would bee as crooked as the given line at its vertex. Againe suppose two streight rulers  &  to bee very trew & steddyly fastened together  which must a very little incline the one to the other, soe as that being produced they would meete at . Then are the lines  , &  given.
Suppose then the point  in the crooked line is to bee found then is  given by supposition, & consequently (supposing  to bee a tangent) . . .  .  . . . & (if ) then is .  being thus found, supposing that , then I take . that is . haveing thus found the point  lay the plate twixt the two rulers so that the point of it, fall upon the point  then should the line  touch the plate in . But note that .
In both telescopes & microscopes tis most convenient to have a convex glasse next the eye for by that meanes the angle of vision will bee much greater than it will bee with a concave one (though both doe magnifie alike). If the convex glasse be Hyperbolicall (&c) make it soe bigg that the penecilli may crosse in the pupill; that is, the exterior focus will be as far distant from the vertex as the eye is. let the glass bee as thinn as may bee that the eye bee not too far from the vertex that it should bee about as thick as the distance of the interior focus from the vertex.
And by this meanes also, (the focus of the objectglasse being within the telescope twixt the glasses) there may bee placed at that focus the edge of <30v> a steele ruler accurately divided into equall parts (to measure the diameters or distances of starrs &c) which should bee soe made that by a pinne or handle it may be placed in any posture & in any parte of the focus, without otherwise altering the Telescope in observations.
Note that were not the glasses faulty they would not onely magnify objects but render vision more distinct; each of the penicilli passing through (perhaps but) the 10th, 20th or 100th parte of the pupill must bee more exactly refracted to one point of the Tunica Retina than in ordinary vision in which each of the penicilli spreads over all the pupill.
 Note also that that the glasse  may be ground Hyperbolicall by the line , if it turne on the mandrill  whilst  turnes on the axis  being inclined to it as was shewed before. If the edge  bee not durable enough, inough instead thereof use a long small cilinder: which I conceive to bee the best way, of all. For a Cilinder of all sollids is most easily made exact (being  turned, as in the figure, by a gage untill its thicknesse bee every where equall). 2 the Cilinder may bee made to slip up & downe & turne round whereby it will not onely grinde the glase crosse wise to take of all hubbes, but also the glasse & cilinder will grinde the one the other truer & truer. All the difficulty is in placing the axis  perpendicular to the Mandrill  & vertex to vertex, which yet may bee done exactly severall ways. & untill then the glasse & Cilinder will not fit. & should the axis not intersect the glasse would bee still Hyperbolicall except a point at the vertex of it. The same instrument may also serve for severall glasses onely making  longer or shorter. Let the Cilinder han{g} over the glasse.

To Grinde Sphæricall optick Glasses
If the glasse  is to bee ground sphærically  hollow: naile a steele plate to the beame , on the upper side: In which make a center hole for the steele point  of the shaft : to which shaft fasten a plugg  of stone or leade or leather &c: (with which you intend to grinde the glasse ): which shaft & plugg being swung to & fro upon the center  will grind the glasse  sphærically hollow.
The manner whereby  glasses may bee ground sphærically convex may appeare by the annexed figure (being the former way inverted). Also the plugg , in the  figure, is ground sphærically 
But if this way bee not exact enough yet hereby may bee {grownd}{ground} plates of mettall well nigh sphæricall, And by those plates may bee ground glasses after the usual manner; If a circular hoope of steele  bee put about the edge of the glasse  to keepe it  from grinding away at the edges faster than in the middle.
But the best way of all will bee to turne the glass circularly upon a mandrill whilest the plate is steadily rubbed upon it or else <31v> to turne the plate upon a mandrill whilest the glasse is rubbed upon it or let sometimes the one, sometimes the other bee turned.: & by this meanes they will either of them weare the other to a truely sphericall forme. but however let there bee a hoope or of some mettall which weares more difficultly then glasse to defend the glasse from wearing more at its edges then in the middle. Perhaps it may doe well first to weare the plate sphæricall by the hoope alone without the glasse. 
The same meanes may bee used for grinding plaine glasses.
Let not an object glasse bee ground sphærically convex on both sides, but sphaerically convex on one side & plane or but a little convex ~ on the other, & turne the convexest side towards the object.

If the Glasses of a Telescope bee not truely ground Theire errors may bee thus found.
Because an error is much more easily discernable in the object glasse than in the eye glasse let us first suppose the eye glasse to bee ground true towards its center, (tis exact enough if it be sphericall, & not Hyperbolicall), & so wee may find & rectifie the errors of the object glasse.
First make a thin plate  of brasse & in the center of it a Small hole (whose diameter perhaps may bee about the 50th or 100dth parte of an inch. With which plate cover the eye glass the center of it respecting the center of the glasse.
Secondly make two other plates the one  with two holes as neare to its edge as may bee their{e}{} distance being about the 5th parte of an inch or lesse, & the other  with one hole close to the midst of its edge. Let the diameters of these 3 holes bee about a 20th parte of an inch or lesse. And theire edges must bee true that they may slide one upon another, & yet not let the suns rays passe through, to which purpose make them oblique. with these two plates cover the object glasse (first stopping the hole of  the holes of the other plate respecting the center of the glasse & looke at a stare (or the edge of the sunne &c) & if the object appeare double (like two starrs &c) make the Tube longer or shorter untill it appeare single.

All the parallell lines which can be understoode to bee drawne uppon any superficies are equivalent to it, as  all the lines drawne from  to  may be used instead of the superficies 
If all the parallell lines drawne uppon any superficies be multiplied by another line they produce a Sollid like that which results from the superficies drawne into the same line  as if either all the lines in the superficies  or if the superficies  be drawne into the line  they both produce the same sollid  whence All the parallell superficies which can bee understoode to bee in any sollid are equivalent to that Sollid. And If all the lines in any triangle, which are parallell to one of the sides, be squared there results a Pyramid. if those in a square, there results a cube. If those in a crookelined figure there results a sollid with 4 sides terminated & bended according to the fashion of the crookelined figure{.}

Reasonings concerning chance.
If 
1 If  is the number of chances by one of which I may gaine , &  those by one of which I may gaine , &  those by one of which I may gaine ; soe that those chances are all equall & one of them must necessarily happen: My hopes or chance is worth . The same is true if , ,  signify any proportion of chances for , , . 
2. If I bargaine for more than one chance (viz: that after I have taken the gaines by my first chance, from the stake ; I will venter another chance at the remaining stake &c) my second lott is worth . My third lot is worth . My Fourth lot is worth . My Fift lot is worth . My sixt lot is worth . &c
As if 6 men  cast a die soe that he gaines  who throws a cise first: since there is but one chance to gaine  & 5 to gaine nothing at each cast, I make .  & . Therefore by the <90v> The first mans lot is worth  The seconds is worth . The thirds is worth . The fourths is  The fifts lot is worth . The Sixts lot is . &c. Soe that their lots are as        .
Soe that if I cast a die two or more times tis  to  that I cast a cise at the first cast &  to  that I throw it at two casts, &  to  that I cast it at thrice, &  to  that I cast it once in 4 trialls, &  to  that I cast it once in 5 times. &c
3. If I bargaine to cast severall sorts of lots successively at the same stake the valor of each lot is thus found viz: The first prop: gives the valor of the first lot; which valor being destructed from the stake, the remainder is the stake of the 2d lot which therefore may bee also found by the first prop: &c.
As if I gaine  by throwing  at the first cast, or  at the 2d or  at the 3d &c with two dice. Since at the first cast there is but one chance for  (viz  ) &  for nothing Therefore its valor is  (by Prop 1). & the stake for the 2d cast is . Now since there are two chances for it (viz: ⚅⚄ & ⚄⚅) &  for  at the 2d cast therefore its valor is . as the stake for the 3d lot is  for which there are 3 chances (viz ⚄⚄, ⚅⚃, ⚃⚅) &  for nothing Therefore its valor is .
<91r>
4 If I bargaine with one or two more to cast lots in order untill one of us by an assigned lott shall win the stake : Since the chances may succede infinitly I onely consider the first revolution of them The valor of each mans whole expectation being in such proportion one to another as the valors of their lots in one revolution. & the valors of each mans first lot being to the valor of his whole expectation as the summe of the valors of their first lots to the stake .
As if I contend with another that who first throws  with 2 dice shall have , I haveing the dice. My first lot is worth  (by prop 1), The 2d his first lot is worth . And  . for the two first lots make one revolution because I have the same lot If I throw a 2d time that I had at the first. Therefore   is my interest in the stake.
If our bargaine bee soe that there is some lott at the beginning of our play which returnes not in the after revolutions, detract the valor of those irregular lotts from the stake & the rest shall bee the stake of the lots which follow & revolve successively. As if I contend with another that who first casts  must have  , onely I have {the} first cast for . My first lot is worth . & the stake for our after throws is . his firts lot being . & my next lot . soe that his share in the stake  is to mine as . Soe that my share in it is . To which adding the valor of my first lot viz: , the summe is , my interest in the stake  at the begining.
5 If the Proportion of the chances for any stake bee irrationall the interest in the stake may bee found after the same manner. As if the Radij  ,  , divide the horizontall circle  into two points <91v>  &  in such proportion as  to   . And if a ball falling perpendicularly upon the center  doth tumble into the portion  I winn : but if into the other portion, I win  . my hopes is worth .
Soe if a die bee not a Regular body but a Parallelipipedon or otherwise unequall sided, it may bee found how much one cast is more easily gotten then another.
 6 Soe that the facility of the chances & the stake belonging to each chance being knowne the worth of the lott may bee ever found by the precedent precepts. And if they bee not both immediatly known they must bee sought before the valor of the lott can bee found.
As if I want two games at Irish & my adversary three to win  , & I would know my interest in the stake  my first lot can gaine me nothing but the advantage of another lot, & therefore to know its vallue I must first find the value of that other lot &c. First therefore if wee each wanted one lot to win  our interest in it would bee equall viz my lot worth . Secondly If I want one game & my adversary two, & I gaine the next game then I gaine  but if I loose it I onely gaine an equall lot for  at the next game which is worth , Therefore my interest in the stake is . Thirdly If I want one game & my adversary three & I gaine the next game I get ; but if I loose it, then I want one game & my adversary but two, that is I get : Therefore (there being one chance for  & one for ) my interest in the stake is . Fourthly If I want 2 games & my adversary 3; & I win I get . but if I loose I get  for our chances <92r> will then bee equall; Therefore my interest in the stake is . Soe if I want  games & my adversary  my interest in  is . If I want two and hee  , it is . If I want  and hee  it is . If I  and hee  , it is: . If I  and hee  it is . If I  and hee  it is . If I  and hee  , it is: . (The like may bee done if 3 or more play together. (as if one wants one game, another 3 a third 4: Their lots are as  . &c.) As also if their lots bee of divers sorts.)
By this meanes also some of the precedent questions may bee resolved. as if I have two throws for a cise to win  , with one die; If I have missed my first lot already, I have at my second cast five chances for nothing. & one for  . therefore that cast is worth . Soe that in my first cast I had five chances for  & one for  , which therefore (with my 2d cast) is worth . That is tis  to  that I cast a cise once in two throws. as before
By this meanes also my lot may bee known if I am to draw  cards of severall sorts out of  cards   of each sort.
Or if out of two white &  black stones I am blindfold to chose a white & a black one.

A Method whereby to square those crooked lines which may be squared.
That a line may be squared Geometrically tis required that its area may be expressed in generall by some equation in which there is an unknowne quantity, so that this quantity being determined the area thereof (comprehended by the crooked line, the two lines to which all the points in the crooked line are referred) is limited & may bee found by the same equation. Also every such equation must be of two dimensions because it expresseth the quantity of a superficies.
That an equation expresse the area of a crooked line tis required that the superficie{s} increase in an unequall proportion, when the line (considered as unknowne) increaseth in arithmeticall proportion, wherefore (suppos ing x always to signifie the unknowne quantity: a, b, c, &c; to signifie the quantitys given) ax, or xx either alone or added to any other supperficies, serve not to find the area of any crooked line which may not be found with out them. 
<120v>  <121r>
Prop:
Haveing an equation of 2 dimensions to find what crooke line it is whose area it doth expresse, suppose the equation is . nameing the quantitys; a = dh = kl. bg = y. db = mk = x = gp. the superficies  supose the square dkhl is equall to the superficies gbd; then , & . which is an equation expressing the nature of the line fmd.
Next making nm=s a line which cutteth dmf at right angles. nd=v.  6 . & . Now supposeing, mb:bn::dh:bg. that is, .  Which is the nature of the line dgw & the area , makeing db=x. dh=a. or. , determining (di) to be (x). &c 
The Demonstration whereof is as followeth
Suppose ω♊♌, ♌mz, zfv; &c are tangents of the line dmf. & from theire intersections z, ♌, v, draw va, zq. ♌s. ωx, & from theire touch points draw fw, mg, ♊ξ. all parallell to kp. also from the same point of intersection draw vσ, zλ, ♌ν. ωh.
<122r>
And mb:nb::bt:bm::♌B:Bm::kl:bg. wherefore ♌B×bg=Bm×kl. that is the rectangle klνμ=bρsg. And. πρs♉=θλνμ. in like manner it may be demonstrated that ;aqπn=θλσρ, & ρωxy=μdνh. &c so that the rectangle ρshd is equall to any number of such like squares inscribed {twixt} the line ny & the point d, which squares if they bee infinite in number, they will bee equall to the superficies dnywgξ.
This being demonstrated that I may shunne confusion in squareing the lines of every sort I shall use this method in. distinguishing them. viz: first such lines whose area is exprest by equations in which the unknowne quantity is numerator, & that 1st all the sines being affirmative, 2dly mixed. 
2dly lines whose area is exprest by quantitys in which the unknowne quantity is divisor, & those 1st under affirmative sines, 2d under mixt one's 3 lines squared by equations mixt of the 2 former kinds, whose quantitys are all 1s affirmative 2dly mixt.

Soe that the nature of every crooked line, whose area is compounded of the area of 2 or more of the former lines, or of the difference of the area of 2 or more of the former lines, is exprest by an equation compounded of the equations expresing the nature of those lines.

A Method whereby to square such crooked lines as may be squared.
If the crooked lines σha & aoθ are of such a nature that (supposeing [gh] parallell to [qa], & [bh] perpendic: to σha & [an] a given line) gh∶bg∷an∶ge. Then the area [age]=[qlna] the rectangle made by [an] & [gh].
Demonstration.
Suppose σi, id, de, &c; are tangents of σha, from whose intersections or ends are drawne, ec, df, iz, σw, &{c}{illeg} & from whose touch points are drawne βθ, ho, λμ, &c: all parallel to av. From the said intersections draw sw, ik, dm, es, &c. parallel to bn. Since gh∶bg∷pd∶ip∷an∶ge. pd×ge=iν×an. that is □pkmt=□uτfs. by the same reason tmso= =τνcy; & vpkw=ζuzx &c: Thus also it may be prooved that the ▭vwna is equall to anyy number of such like ▭s inscribed twixt the line ζω & the point a, which if they be infinite are equall to superficies ζaω=vwna .also gπμo. =ql♊♌. &c.

Of Musick.
1. First some one sound must bee pitched upon, to which all the musick must bee more especially refered than to any other sound, (as number to an unit) let this sound be called the Cliffe or Key of the song.
2. Then consider the sound which is one or two or thre 8ths above or below that key (for Musick seldome takes a larger compasse than 3 8ths) The cheife of which is the 8th next above the Key. 3.Each of these Eights are alike divided into parts, for the parts of the higher eight are an Eight above their correspondent parts of the lower eight. so that the parts of one Eight knowne give all the rest, the other Eights being but a repetition of that. in {a}more base or treble sound. (Hence some call an 8th the largest consonant.) 
4. This Eight is first divided into a 5t & 4th, the fift being next above the Key; to which it adds so much sweetnesse that should this fift bee omitted in any song, the Key would imparte its name & nature to some sound which hath a fift above it. And since all harmony without a fift is flat, therefore the key must necessarily have a fift above it. ✝ < insertion from f 137v > ✝ here annex a discourse of the motion of strings sounding an 8t 5t & 4th & of the Logarithmes of those strings, or distances of the notes.
< text from f 138r resumes >
5. An 8th is next divided into a third major & 6t minor, & lastly into a 3d minor & 6t major. * < insertion from f 137v > * these are all the concords conteined in an Eight. Hereto annex a discourse of the 3ds & 6ts
The notes in order of concordance
Eight. 5t. 3d maj. 4th. 6t maj. 3d min. 6t min. 2d maj. 7th maj 7th min. 2d min. 5t min. < text from f 138r resumes > But as too suddaine a change from lesse to greater light offfends the eye by reason that, the spirits rarified by the augmented motion of the light too violently stretch the optick nerve: soe the suddaine passing from grave to acute sounds is not so pleasant as if it were done by degrees, because of too greate a change of motion made thereby in the auditory spirits .✝ < insertion from f 137v > ✝And as a man suddainely cooming from greater to lesse light, cannot discerne objects thereby so well, as if he came to it by degrees or as when hee hath staid some while in the lesser light (by reason that the motion of the spirits in the optick nerve caused by the greater light, doth, untill it bee allayed; disturbe & as it were drowne the motion of the weaker light) soe if the slower motion of the lower sound immediately succede the much more smart motion of the higher its impression on the auditory spirits — being then less perceptible, the lower sound must bee less pleasant that if the step had beene graduated, Thus a little heate is least perceptible to one newly come from a greater. Coroll: 1. The distance of sounds adds to the imperfection of their concordance. Cor: 2: Tis better to descend than ascend by leapes the first makeing the highest sound harsher, the seacond makeing the lower onely lesse perceptible. < text from f 138r resumes > Which graduation may be thus don.
6. The prime parts of an 8th are a 5t & 4th: of a fift are a 3d major & 3d minor: which two consist the first of a tone major & tone minor, the 2d of a tone major & semitone. A 4th consists of a tone major, minor & semitone. Soe that an eight consists of thre <139r> tone majors, 2 tone minors, & 2 semitones. [The tones might be againe divided into  tones &  tones, but they would bee of noe use for tones  tones &  tones being discords can onely serve to move by from concord to concord which if done by  tones &  tones the number of discords twixt each concord would much more bee harsh than the concord would bee pleasant, besides  tones &  tones are harsher discords by far than tones, & experience speakes that an 8th run over by  notes is unpleasant. Yet perhaps  or  notes passed over very hastily with a larger stay upon the concords twixt which they are, might bee delightfull. But since they are such discords, inserted as 'twere by accident onely to graduate concords, & soe quickly slipt over, the sence cannot perceive any error or exactnesse in them, & therefore bee they usefull yet to treate of them would be lost labor]
7. The degrees (viz 2 tone majors, a tone minor & semitone in the 5t & a tone major, a tone minor & semitone in a 4th) are 12 severall ways ordered in the 8th which orders are called Modes, generally, because they much limit the partes of the tune from discord sounds of one with another particularly because tunes framed by divers of them differ in their aires or Modes.
8. These modes are 3 fold, viz: 6 in which the  notes are distant 2 tones: foure in which they are distant one tone: & 2 in which they are together. The last two are of small or noe use, because every sound is distant 3 tones from some other excepting that there are but 2 fifts. Also thos  notes are two harsh to come together much more to bee annext to the Key or its fift. Neither is the seacond sort very useful for one of the  notes are annexed either to the Key or its 5t or 8t, also 4 of its sounds are distant 3 notes & but 4 of them are distant a fift from some other: whereas there are but 2 in those of the first sort distant {those} notes & six of them distant fifts from other sounds.; the harshnes of the  notes being there also more moderated by their distance. And therefore the first 6 are yet in use.
<139v>
9. The following table may expresse the 12 Modes in their order of Elegancy. In which the tone major & minor are not distinguished, their difference being too little to make new modes by their order changed, though thereby they may add much grace or harshnesse to any particular mode.
 
This order may be thus evinced. The first Mode excells the 2d, by reason of the  Note's more convent place twixt the Key & its fift, it lesse detracting from the fift because of its greater distance from it. Also the key hath its 3d major & the fift its 3d minor in the 1st mode, but contrarily in the 2d mode the key hath its 3d minor & the 5t its 3d major. The sweetness of the key in the 3d mode is still more diminished by haveing the  note imediateely below it & its 8ts. The 4th Mode succedes as partakeing of the 3ds defect; the sweetnesse of its key's 5t, & consequently of its key, being also diminished by the  note immediately above it. The 5t mode succeds because to the imperfections of the 4th this is added that its first  note is next above the key & its fifts have tritones. The 6t mode is yet more unpleasant <141r> for both the key, its 5ts, & eights have a  note next below them: Also the key & its eights have tritones above & below them. Other reasons might bee added for this order, & also for the order of the sixt last modes; & it might perhaps bee shown that the 7th mode may bee as usefull as the Sixt, but that would bee tedious. Note, that sometime a note is put out of its place for some particular reason (as to prevent a greater discord &c) but that seemes soe rare & accidentall to the song as not to change its aire or constitute a new mode.
10. The tones major & minor may bee six severall ways ordered in each mode & but 10 severall ways in all the six first modes. . the first is by makeing the distances, pq, rs, vo, to bee tone majors op, & st, to bee tone minors. In this order there are five 5ts, 3 third majors, & 3 third minors in an 8th. Thus is the 3d 5t & first mode best ordered, & thus may the 4th & 6t moode bee ordered but not the 2d well for its keys fift will thenbee oo flat. The 2d way is by putting the tone minor twixt, o & p, r & s. This order makes also 5 fifts, thre 3d majors & 3 3d minors, in each 8th. And thus may the 4th, 6t, & 2d Moode bee best ordered; the 3d & 5t moode may bee also ordered thus, but the first not well, for the Keys 5t will then bee too flatt. The 3d way is by putting the minor note betwixt r & s, v & o. & thus each 8th will have five fifts, 2 third majors & 2 minor thirds. The 4th 6t & 2d moode may bee well thus ordered the 1st & 5t not so well & the 3d worst of all. The 4th Order is by putting the minor tone twixt p & q, s & t & thus each 8th hath 5 fifts, 2 minor 3ds, & 2d moode bee ordered well, but the 6t & 4th moode not well. The other six orders are lesse convenient to the Moodes. Note that, In every 8th there are 6 5ts, 3 major thirds & 4 minor thirds whereof one or more of them are mad{e} too flat or sharpe by about the 10th parte of a note, but in this computation I onely reckon the exact concords <141v> Esteeming that order more perfect whose sounds agree in more of the exact concords. Note also that every Eight hath soe many exact 4ths, 6t minors & third majors as it hath 5ts, 3d majors & 3d minors their complements to an 8th.
12. It may bee required sometimes to raise or let fall the voyce in singing which is best done by raising or depressing the key of the song a fift, (if an 8t be too greate), for that will bee consonant with the former sound which is now become (for the present) gratefull to the eare. Also instruments are usually tuned one a fift above another if the keys of severall parts be a fift one above another; & a tune might bee pricked for too high a voyce in one parte of the Gamut & too base a voyce if removed an 8th lower. Hence ariseth a comparison of the same moode with it selfe placed a fift higher. The precedent scheme may serve to represent any of the six modes repeated six times with the distance of a fift twixt each, according to the order of the left hand figures. But they cannot bee soe repeated more than 3 times, unlesse with more discord than harmony.
   
Any of the 6 Moodes with its eights may bee represented by any of these 3 orders of letters for the key being o they re present the first Moode, & the second it being, s, & the 3d if it be r &c: Also the first ranke being lowest the 2d a fift above it & the 3d a fift above that,this scheame may represent any of the Modes with the same mode one or 2 fifts above or below it.
<142r>
11. These degrees have of old beene expressed by the Six notes, vt, re, mi, fa, sol, la, the 7th note being omitted as being a discord to the key in the first moode. But of late the usuall notes are sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la, fa, hitherto expressed by the letters o, p. q. r. s.t. v. Tis generally best (by see 10) to make the distance from sol to la, to be a minor tone, from la to mi & fa to sol a major tone, & a semitone from la to fa & mi to fa. Onely in the 2d Mode make sol & la & mi to bee distant a major tone, fa a minor tone from sol els the fift to the key will bee too flat. Or thus if the key bee f, a, b, or c make the distances twixt g & a, c & d to bee a minor tone if the key bee d or e make the distances from f to g & c to d a minor tone, but if it be g make a−g=d−c=g−f.
<143r>
13. Tis usuall to passe from one moode to another in the midst of a song which how & to what moode it may be done will appeare by the precedent scheme. For the 3 rankes may signifie any three Moodes which have one common key, as F is the key of the first third & sixt Moode, G the key of the first 2d & 4th mood &c: And wee may passe from any of those Moodes to another which in that scheme have the same key. But this transition is better done from one key to the key next it, than to the remoter key. Neither may it bee done twixt any other Moodes as twixt the first & fift or 3d & 4th by reason of their great difference, which would soe change the aire of the song as to make the parts of it rather seeme divers songs.
14. It may app10) that if the key bee f, or b, or e, the the transition may be best done the degrees of the Moode being ordered the first way. If the key bee a or d the 2d order is best. If the key bee g the 3d order is best, & the fourth the key being c. But in generall, if the degrees bee ordered the 4th way in the 2d Moode & the 1st way in all the rest, this transition may bee well done. 
15. from the consideration of passing from one moode to another in the same song two other moodes may bee usefull the one whereof wants the key the other its fift, but these defects are parly supplyed by the eares retaining the impression of their sweetness made by the former parte of the song. q is the key of one moode & v the key's 5t in the other moode.

And in generall if the valor of y consists of severall termes so that x is not of divers dimensions in the denominator of any terme, then multiply each terme by x & divide it by the number of the dimensions of x, all those products shall bee the area of the given line: supposeing also that either none or all the signes of those termes are changed by this operation. For if some bee changed & others bee not they proceed divers ways & joyne not, & then the quantitys y or x must be increased or diminished or otherwise altered.
The reason of this prop: is, that the area described by y is also described by its parts that is by the termes of its valor, & what areas those termes describe appeares by prop 3d. 
Prop 5t. The progressions in this Table may bee designed by these geomet: lines. Whereby also any intermediate termes may bee found.

The truth of this appeares also by the 5t & 6t proposition, or by calculation If a>b.
The truth of these two prop: is also thus demonstrated If  I divide, 1 by a+b as in decimall fractions & find the quote  &c as appeareth also by multiplying both parts by a+b. So I extract the {note} of a2+b as if they were decimall numbers & find   &c, as also may appeare by squareing both parts

I multiply each terme of that equation by so many times py or  as x hath dimensions in it, & also by soe many times qx or  as y hath dimensions in it. the summe of these products is an equation expresing the relation of the motions of c & d.

Experiments about the resistance of things falling in water.
1. I filled to the top a wooden vessel  inches square within &  foot  inches high within. And making balls of bees wax of several bignesses with pieces of Lead stuck in them to give them weight: three balls each of which weighed in the air  grains & in the water  grains, fell each of them in the water from the top to the bottom of the vessel in 15″ of time the motion of descent being (to {sence}) uniform almost from the top to the bottom. so then a globe equall to  grains of water moving uniformly  foot  inches in 15″ of time feels a resistance equal to  grains of weight.
2. Two balls, each weighing in air  grains in water  grains fell each of them the same height of  foot  {dig.} in 4″ of time. And these experiments seemed sufficiently accurate.

Definitions.
[66] 1st When a body Quantity  from one parte of Extension to another it is saide to mo{ve.}
2 One body Quantity is soe much swifter than another, as the distance through which it passeth is greater than the distance through which the other passeth in the same time.
3 One Quantity hath so much more motion than another, as the distance through which it moveth drawne into its quantity, is to the distance trough which the other moveth in the same time drawne into its quantity. As if the line  move the length of   &  the length of  in the same time, the motion of  is to the motion of , as , to .  Alsoe if the cube  move the length of ; & the piramis  move the length of  in the same time; then, as,  the motion of  to the motion . Or the motion of one quantity to another is as their powers to persever in that state
Those Quantitys are said to have the same determination of their motion which move the same way, & those have divers which move divers ways.
[67] 5 A quantity is reflected when meeting with another quantity it looseth the determination of its motion by rebounding from it. As if the bodys ,  meete one another in the point  they are parted  either by some springing motion in them selves or in the matter {crouded} betwixt them. & as the spring is more dull or vigorous quick soe the bodys will bee reflected with th more or lesse force; as if it endeavour to get liberty to inlarge it selfe with as greate strength & vigor as the bodys  , pressed it together, the motion of the body  from  will bee as greate after as before the reflection. but if the spring have but halfe that vigor, then the distance twixt  & ,at the minute after the reflection shall bee halfe as much as it was at the minute beef{ore} the reflection.
 7 Refraction is when the body  passing obliquely through the surface  at the point  meets with more opposition on one side of the surface than on the other & soe looseth its determination; as if it turne towards .
[68] 9 Force is the pressure or erouding of one body upon another,
10 The center of { Motion } in the same body is such a point within a quantity which rests when a body is moved with any circular but noe progressive motion; also the line in  drawne through it is called an axis of motion.
The center of motion in 2 divers bodys is a point soe placed twixt those bodys that (if it bee conceived to rest ) if the bodys bee moved about it with circular motion they shall both have an equall quantity {o}f motion, the line about which they move is the axis of motion.
12 A Body is said to move toward another body either when all its points move towar{d}s it or else when some of its points have more motion towards it than others have from it. Otherwise not

13 Bodys are more or lesse distant as the distances of their centres of motion are more or lesse. or as their distances might bee acquired with more or less motion

Axiomes. Propositions.
1 If a quantity once move it will never rest unlesse hindered by some externall caus{e.}
2 A quantity will always move on in the same streight line (not changing the determination {nor} celerity of its motion) unlesse some externall cause divert it.
3 There is exactly required so much & noe more force to reduce a body to rest as there was {to} put it {illeg}n motion: et e contra.
4 S{illeg} much {illeg}{illeg}s is required to destroy any quantity of motion in a body soe {illeg} to generate it; & soe much as is required to generate it soe mu{illeg}ived to destroy it.
[69]6 {illeg}ove 2 unequall bodys ( & ) the swiftnesse of one body  is to the s{illeg} is to  . {(1)} & therefore the motion of both bodys shall bee equall.
5 If {illeg}{b}ee moved by unequall forces, as the force moveing  is to the force {illeg} motion of . to the m{illeg} of , so is the swiftnes of , to that of .

[71] 8 If two quantitys ( & ) move towards one another & meete in , Then the difference of theire motion shall not bee lost nor loose its determination. For at their occursion they presse equally uppon one another, & (p)[72] therefore one must loose noe more motion than the other doth; soe that the difference of their motions cannot be destroyed.
[73] 9 If two equall & equally swift bodys ( & ) meete one another they shall bee reflected, soe as to move as swiftly frome one another after their reflection as they did to one another before it. For first suppose the sphæricall bodys  to have a springing or elastick force soe that meeting one another they will relent & be pressed into a sphæroidicall figure, {&} in that moment in which there is a period put to theire motion towards one another theire figure will be most sphæroidicall & theire pression one upon the other is at the greatest, & if th{e} endeavour to restore theire sphæroidicall figure bee as much vigorous & forcible as theire pressure upon one another was to destroy it they will gaine as much motion from one another their parting as they had towards one another theire reflection. Secondly suppose they be sphæricall & absolutely sollid then at the period of theire motion towards one another (that is at the moment of theire meeting) theire pression is at the greatest or rather tis done with the whole force by which theire motion is stopt, for theire whole motion was stoped by the force of theire pressure upon one another in ysone moment & there cannot  divers degrees of pressure twixt two bodys in one moment) Now so long as neither of these 2 bodys yeild to one another they will retaine the same forcible pressure towards one another: that is soe much force as deprived the bodys of their motion ( towards one another soe much doth now urge them from one another, & therefore (r)[74] they shall move from one another as much as they did towards one another before theire reflection.
10. There is the same reason when unequall & unequally moved bodys reflect, that they should seperate from one another with as much m{ot}ion as they came together.
[75] [76] 
 11 If a line  be bisected in  about which the line  doth circulate & that point bee fixed. then the whole line hath noe progressive motion. For makeing , , , &  bee parallel, & perpendic to , then is . & . Wherefore the point  moveing towards  the point  shall move soe much towards the line  as the point  doth from it, & all the points in  or the line  move as much to the line  as all the points in  or the line  moves from it soe that the whole line  stays in equilibrio neither moveing to nor from , by the 12th Defin.
12 Hence when the center of a line  is not in the midst of a line  the whole line moves the same way which the longest parte doth. for supposeing  then the line  in equilibrio (per axiom:11) but if  moves towards  & be added to  then  moves towards  (by def {12}
13. When  moves circularly but maketh noe progression its middle point shall rest & is therefore the center of its motion, for if the middle point move let it bee to  from  soe that the line  bee moved into the place {} then let the {} move about the fixed center  into the place , then {} & {} are equally distant from  (by definition 13 & axiom 11) & alsoe  &  are equally distant from the {illeg}{am} f{illeg} but  &  are not equally distant from f{illeg}{illeg}ore neither are  &  equally distant from . & therefore the line {illeg} pro{gre}ssive motion when it {pressed} into {}

[77] 
14 A Body being moved parallell to its selfe all its points describe parallel lines, & each them have the same determination & velocity with the body. for (by axiome 2d) they must all bee streight ones which if they intersect the body will not be moved parallel to its selfe.      &c.
[78] 17 If a body move streight forward & circularly its center of motion shall have the same determinacon & velocity that the body hath. For {suppose}  to be moved into the place  & its center of motion  into the place , then let it turne about the center  into the place  parallel to to  soe that the point which was in  bee now in . Now since {} by moveing into the place  makes noe progressiv motion (definition 10) it follows that the same quantity (Or since ) the same velocity & (axiom 10) determination of motion in the same time would translate  parallell to it selfe into the place  that would translate it into the place  , had it both progressive & circular motion. But the point  hath the same velocity & determination which the line  hath when moved parallel to its selfe (x)[79] therefore the point  hath the same determinacon & velocity which the line  hath when moved with both circular & progressive motion vide axiom 37.
18 If a body move progressively in some crooked line & alsoe circularly its center of motion shall have the same determination & velocity which the body {hath} for (axiom 17) this is trew when its motion is in a streight line but a crooked line may bee conceived to consist of an infinite number of streight lines. Or else in any point of the crooked line the motion may bee conceived to be on in the tangent.
[80] 19 If 2 bodys make the same number of circulations with the same dista{nce} from the center  : then as the Radij of the circles which their centers of motion describe are to one another soe are the perimeters one to another soe are theire velocitys one to another (axiom 10, definition 2), & their motions are to one another as theire bulkes drawne into the Radij of those circles (which theire centers of motion describe) are to one another (definition 3). As:  velocity of  velocity of . &  motion  motion of .
[81] 20 If a sphære  move with in the concave sphæricall or cilindricall surface of the body  circularly about the center  it shall press upon the body  for when it is in  (supposeing the circle  to be described by its center of motion & the line  a tangent to that circle at ) it moves towards  or the determination of its motion is towards       therefore if at that moment the body  should cease to check it it would continually move in the line  (axiom 1. 2.) obliqly from the center  , but if the body  oppose it selfe to this indeavour keeping it equidistant from  , that is done by a continued checking or reflection of it from the tangent line in every point of the circle  , but the body  cannot check & curbe the determination of the body  unless they continually presse upon one another. The same may be understood if the body  bee restrained into circular motion by the thred  
21. Hence it appeares that all bodys moved circularly have an endeavour from the center about which they move, otherwise the body  would not continually presse upon  .
22 The whole force by which a body  indevours from the center  in halfe a revolution {i}s more than double to the force which is able to generate or destroy its motion for supposeing it have moved from  by  to  then the resistance of the body  (which is equall to its pressure upon  ) is able to destroy its force of moveing {illeg}{illeg} & to generate in it as much force of moveing from  to  the qu{illeg}g way.
[82] 2{5}{3} Having {illeg}of motion of the 2 bodys  &  to find the common center of both {in}{illeg}draw a line  from the centers of theire motions  &  & divi{illeg}oe that the body  is to the body  as the line  to the line  : that is soe{illeg}  . For then if they move about the center {illeg}{illeg}{illeg} they have equall motion (axiom 19th) & consequen{tly} {illeg} <12r> have an equall endeavour from the center  (axiom 23) soe that if they bee joyned to center  by the lines  &  the one hindereth the other from forcing the center  any way soe that it shall stand in equilibrio betwixt them & (by definition 10) is therefore their center of motion
[83] 
24 If two bodys (  &  move about a center  then ∼ ∼ ∼ ∼ ∼ ∼ The whole force by which the body  tends from the center  in one revolution being equall to {6}{61} times the force by which that body is moved (axiom 22) is to the motion of that body as the whole force by which the body  tends from the center  in one revolution (which is equall to 6{+} times the force by which the  is moved, or which is able to stop its motion (axiom 22) ) is to the motion of the body  . Vide Axioma 23ũ.
[84] 26 If the body  move through the space   in the time  , & the body  through the space   in the time  . then the velocity of  is to the velocity of  as  to   . For supposeing that . then is  And (by definition 2) the velocity of  is to the velocity of 
[85] Alsoe the motion of  is to the motion of  (by definition 3d)  .
Note that when the motion is uniforme that is when a body moves over the same space in the same time (which will ever bee when the motion of that body is neither helped nor hindred) then in a right angled triangle  may designe the space through a body moveth in the time . Otherwise when tis not uniforme the proportion of the time in which a body moves to the distance through which it moves may be designed by lines drawne to a crooked line, as the time by  &  , the distance by  or  , the velocity by the proportion of  to  ,  being tangent to the crooked line at  . &c.
[86] 23  If the body  acquire the motion  by the force  & the body  the motion p by the force  . then . for suppose the body  , to acquire the motion  by the force  , then (axiom 5)[87]  . but  (by axiom 4) therefore .
Axiom {1}00 Every thing doth naturally persevere in that state in which it is unlesse it bee interrupted by some externall cause, hence axiome 1st, & 2d, & {γ}, A body once moved will always keepe the same celerity, quantity & determination of its motion.
[88] 
101 . Supposeing the bodys  &  to be equall & equivelox: Then that cause hindrence, impediment resist{ance} or opposition which can onely deprive  of its whole velocity & motion by hindering its p{er}severance can also onely deprive  of its whole {whole velocity &} motion {illeg} that caus hath the same {illeg}{illeg} over both the bodys.

[89] 102 Since beacuse  is double to  & both of them equivelo{x} therfore the opposition which can deprive  of its motion must be double to that which can deprive  of its motion; by the same reason it will follow that in equivelox bodys as one body  is to another  soe must the resistance which can deprive that body  of its  bee to the resistance which can deprive  of its whole  so is the resistance which can deprive  of some parte of its velocity, to the resistance which can deprive  of the same quantity of velocity, soe that  &  bee still equivelox.
103 By the same reason alsoe If two bodys rest or bee equivelox: then as the body  is to the body  soe must the power or efficacy vigor strength or virtue of the cause which begets new velocity in  bee to the power virtue or efficacy of the cause which begets the = same quantity of velocity in  , soe that  &  bee still equivelox.
104 Hence it appeares how & why amongst bodys moved some require a more potent or efficacious cause others {a lesse} to hinder or helpe their velocity. And the power of this cause is usually called force. And as this cause useth or applyeth its power or force to hinder or change the perseverance of bodys in theire state, it is said to Indeavour to change their perseverance.
[90] 105 If the equall & equivelox bodys  &  meete (unlesse they could passe that one through the other by penetrating its dimentions) they must necessarily hinder the one the others progression, & since these bodys have noe advantage the one over the other the hindrance on both parts will be equall, likewise if the bodys  &  bee equall & equivelox they must equally hinder one anothers progression But the body  (being lesse than the body  & equivelox with  ) cannot hinder the progression of the body  soe much as the body  can; for {then} the power of  being part of the power of the body  would bee equall to the whole power of  therefore that  &  being equivelox doe equally hinder the one the others progression tis required that they be equall.
[91] 106 Now if the bodys  &  meete one another the cause which hindereth the progression of  is the power which  hath to persever in its velocity or state & is usually called the force of the body  & is soe that a body is {so} to be moved with more or lesse force which meeting with another body can cause a greater or lesse mutation in its state, or which requireth more or less force to destroy its motion. & as {one} body  useth or applyeth this force to stop the progression of  it is said to Indeavour to hinder the progression of  which indeavour in body is performed by pressure & by the same reason the body  may bee said to endeavor to helpe the motion of  if it should apply its force to move it forward: soe that it is evident what the Force & indeavor in bodys are.
[92] 107 If the bodys  &  be equivelox then as  the force with which  is moved (or the power of  to persever in its velocity or to {keepe}{helpe} {illeg} hinder another body from persevering in its velocity to the force of  . For let there be 2 other bodys  &  equivelox to them soe that  meeting  , &  meeting  they would eqaully hinder one others progression then is  , &  (axiom 105) &  then force which can stop  (= to the force of  ) to the force which can stop  (= to the force of  ). (vide axiom 102.
[93] 108 Tis knowne by the light of nature that equall forces shall effect an equall change in equall bodys. Therefore if the forces , , , , be equall, & the bodys , , equall & rest, then let  bee moved by the force  ; &  by  ,  &  shall be equivelox: Also (since tis noe greater change for  to acquire another part of motion now it hath one than for it to acquire that one when it had none) if  bee againe moved forward by the force  , its velocity shall be double to the velocity of  , & if it bee againe moved forward by the force  its velocity shall be triple to that of  . &c. Whence as the force moving  is to the force moving  soe is the velocity acquired in  to the velocity acquired in  {by that force}
109 By the same reason if  & the velocity of  be triple to the velocity of  , that force can deprive  of its velocity. which is triple to the force which can deprive  of its velocity. Or in generall {2} so is the lost velocity of  to the lost velocity of  As the force which deprives  of some or all of its velocity, to the force which deprives  of some or all of its velocity

[94] 112 A body is saide to have more or lesse motion as it is moved with more or lesse force, that is as there is more or lesse force required to generate or destroy its whole motion.
[95] 113 If a body  move through the space   in the time  . & the body  through   in the time  then, time  time  line   . & the body  would move through the space  in the same time  in which the body  moves through the space  . Therefore the velocity of  is to the velocity of  as the line  line   (definition 2) Then I add the body  to  soe that  . since  &  are equivelox, (axiom 107) as  force or motion of  , to  force of . againe since  , (axiom 111) as the velocity of  ; to the velocity of   the force or motion of  , to  to the force of  . Soe that,  . Soe that haveing any 7 of these the 8th may bee found. but suppose the bodys moved in equall times that is if  , then the rest of the termes may bee found by,  . &c. that is as  is to  soe is the motion  of the body  to the motion  of the body  . &c.
[96] 110. If the bodys (  &  ) bee equall & the celerity of  triple to that of  , then if the force  can deprive  of its motion, the force  can deprive  of its motion. But if there bee lesse force  it cannot deprive  of its motion for soe the parte  would be = to the whole  ; if there be more force  it will doe more than deprive the body  of its motion (i.e. move it the contrary way) otherwise the parte  would be equall to the whole  . Therefore the  force which can deprive  of its motion must bee triple to the force which can deprive  of its motion & consequently (definition 106) the force wherwith  is moved is triple to the force wherewith  is moved
111 By the same reason as the celerity of the body  is to the celerity of  so is the force wherewith  moveth to the force wherewith  moveth.
[97] 114 There is required soe much & noe more force to reduce a body to rest than there is to move it: et e contra. And
115 Soe much force  is required to generate any quantity of motion in a body so much is required to destroy it, & e contra. For in loosing or to getting the same quantity of motion a body suffers the same quantity of mutacon in its state, & in the same body equall forces will effect a equall change
[98] 116 If the bodys  ,  &  are moved with the same force  then the celerity of  is triple to the celerity of  . for  moved by  is equivelox to  moved by  , but since  , therfore  moved by  is equivelox to  moved by  . And (axiom 108) as the celerity of  moved by  is to the celerity of  moved by  , soe is  to  , soe is the celerity of  moved by  to the celerity of  moved by  .
By the same reason, Any bodys  &  being moved by the same force as  is to  , soe is the celerity of  to the celerity of  acquired by that force. tis axiome the 4th And (by axiom 113) the bodys will have equall motion.
[99] 118 If the body  , be moved by the force  , &  by the force  , to find  the celerity of  &  that of  , I add  to  , soe that  , & that  , &  are moved with equall force, then  the celerity of , (axiom 117) alsoe, (axiom 108) . Or  . that is the celerity of  is to the celerity of  as  is to . And by axiom 113 the motion of  is to the motion of  as the force of  to the force of  . And by the same reason if the motion of  &  bee hindered by the force  &  , the motion lost in  is to the motion lost in  , as  is to  . or if the motion of  be increased by the force  , but the motion of  hindered by the force  ; as  , to  proportional so is the increase of motion in  , to the decrease of it in  (axiom 111
[100] 121 If 2 bodys  &  {nest} the one the other, the resistance in both is the same for soe much as  presseth upon  so much  presseth on  . And therefore they must both suffer an equall mutacion in the motion.
119 If  presseth  towards  then  presseth  towards  . {illeg} without {illeg}
120 A body must move that way which it is pressed.

[101] 27 If two bodys  &  move from  their center of gravity they shall have equal motion For suppose  moved into the place  ; then putting,  (axiom 25) the body  must be then moved into the place  .

[106]28 & 30th. The bodys (  &  ) being in  &  ,  &  ,  &  , in the same times, &   being described by their centers of motion. Also making  . & . Then  (for the motions of  &  are uniform)  (for )  . Againe  (for  (proposition 25)). Therefore  & consequently the points    are in one streight line. also since  the center of motion must bee uniforme. 
[107] 31 If two bodys (  &  ) meete & reflect one another at their center of motion shall bee in the same line  after reflection in which it was before it. For the motion of  towards  the {center} of their motion is equall to the motion of  towards  , by proposition 25. then drawing { } & { }. then  . therefore the bodys  &  have equall towards the points  & {  }. that is towards the line  . And {illeg} {illeg} reflection so much as  presseth  from the {illeg} after reflection that is  {illeg} {illeg}  . {  } &  {illeg}   {illeg} tis {illeg} equall {illeg} the {illeg} <14v> must therefore be the center of motion of the bodys  &  when they are in the places  &  . & it is in the line  . The Demonstracon is same in all cases.
[108] 32  If the bodys (  &  ) reflect at  to  &  , & the center of their motion describe the line  . the velocity of that center  after reflection shall bee equall to the velocity of that center  before reflection. For from the center  draw the lines  perpendicularly to  . & suppose the line  to have the same celerity which (the point  ) the center of motion hath before reflection, soe that when the bodys (after reflection are in  &  , the line  may bee in  . Also draw    . Then since  is the center of motion in  &  , the bodys  &  have equall motion towards  , but,  . Therefore, the bodys  &  have equall motion towards  &  that is towards the line  . Now when the bodys reflect, so much as the body  presseth the body  from the line  (or  ) or towards  soe much the body  presseth the body  from the same line, or towards  , (by x axiom 119) therefore the bodys  , &  , have equall motion from the line  , after reflection (by axiom 121) that is when are at  &  they doe equally move from the points  &  ; then drawing  , tis . Therefore the bodys doe equally move from the point  which (by axiom 25) must bee their center of motion, & since the motion of the line (  or  ) is uniforme (by supposition) & the point  is in the line  , & also in  (by proposition 31.) its motion must be uniforme.
Note that by this, & the 31th proposition I can find the center of motion of two bodys at any given time; & by proposition 9, or definition 5th, I can find their distance, & by proposition 25, their distance from their center of motion. that is the 2 spheres in whose perimeters they be found; There wants therefore onely their determination to bee knowne that their places in the spære may bee found.
[109] 33 Suppose the body  immoveable, the surface  being plaine. Also let the sphæricall body  bee moved in the perpendicular  . so as to be reflected in  Then since the side  hath as much force to weigh or presse towards  as the side  to presse towards  by reason that  the center of its motion is in the line  (       ) the body must be in equilibrio neither pressed towards  nor  but reflected back in the line  . The same may be said of any bodys whose motion center is in the perpendicular to the reflecting point.
[110] 34 Take  . soe that . Then draw the perpendiculars  ,  ,  ,  . And Set a body  upon the points  &  & let  stand on the points  &  which are in the perpendiculars  , &  , &  , on the points  , &  & lay a Globe  let the same be supposed of  . Then suppose (for distinctions sake  have 8 parts of force, with which it presseth  . Then must  presse with 8 parts of force, that is (since  , or  ) with 4 parts on the point  , & with 4 on the point  upon the body  , so that  must presse with 4 parts of force viz: (since it presseth equally on the points  &  ) it presseth on  with 2 parts of force & with the other 2 at  on the body  so that  presseth with 2 parts of force, viz: with one on the point {  }{  } with the other on the point  ; Soe that the body  hath 7 parts of pression upon the point  , 4 at  , 2 at  , & one at  , & since the pressure of all the point   &  is directly towards {  }  will be pressed by it all. but the Globe causeth but one part of pression upon  . Now if these bodys  ,  ,  , understood continually to diminish & come nearer to the line  the pressure of the body  upon  &  will still bee the same that is as  is to  , & so is the line  to  . By the same reason it may be generally pronounced  pressure of the body  upon  to the pressure of it upon  
35 Or if the bodys  &  bee supposed united by the line (  ) & another body  moving towards them hit perpendicularly upon the line  at  ; as  to  so is the pressure of  upon {  } to its pressure upon  , so is the motion in  to the motion in  which is generated in them by those pressures of  , that is which they received from  , at the moment of reflection, & which they might continually injoy as in fig 6t.[111] did not their union by the line  hinder
By the same reason if  reflect {nor} twixt the bodys, then  pression of  towards  to the pression of  towards  motion of  to {  } motion of  to  .

[113] 36 If the   &  doe rest, but soe that the body  moveing perpendicularly to  to them & refleting on the line  (which is supported by but not fastened to the bodys  &  & ought now to be conceived a line onely.) doth move them by communicating its whole motion to them which it selfe looseth, Tis required what motion  &  shall receive from  . Suppose that in so much time as  moveth to  before reflection in so much time it moveth from  to  after reflection & in so much time the bodys  &  move the one to  the other to  ; & that then the point of reflection  is moved to  . Then naming the given quantitys . . . . . the whole motion of  &  to  &  call  , that is  , or if  , (then  is the center of the bodys motion )     ) & if  , then  is a line described by their center of motion Then is (     ) .[114] Now, as the motion of  to the motion of  (proposition 34) so is  to  ; Therefore (axiom 113) as the velocity of  to the velocity of   . that is  . but ;that is  ; or  . &  .  .  . therefore,  . &   . Also (by axiom 9th)  . Therefore  . Now since  hath soe much motion before reflection as all three bodys  have afterward, therefore (axiom 113)  ; Or, . That is . Or, . Or, calling  ; then  . Soe that by this Equation the point  twixt the bodys  &  being then their center of motion may bee always found. Note that the lines  &  must be described by the centers of motion of 2 bodys on divers sides of the point  that is  by center of motion of the body  or  , &  by the center of  or  
37 Now when  &  or  &  are united together (as in the 2d fig) they cannot seperate the one from the other, & therefore since (when they are not equivelox)  is longer than  , the one cannot be at  when the other is at  , but they will check the one the others motion soe as their centers of motion shall not describe streight lines (as  or  ) but crooked ones (as perhaps Trochoides as  , ). yet the common center of their motion  or  shall retaine both the same determinacon & velocity that it would did the bodys move parallell to them selves or were they not united (by axiom {7}{17}). Soe that if the conjoyned bodys (fig 2d) move to  &  in the same time that they would have moved to  &  were they their center of motion  when they are at  &  is {the} same that it would be wer they at {illeg} & therefore may be found by the {illeg} rule, viz;  the {veloci}ty of the point  ; to the velocity of the body {illeg} befor{e}{illeg}{r}eflection.

How to find the axes vertices Diamiters, Centers, or Asymptotes of any Crooked Line supposeing it have them.
[1] Definitions. 
[2] 3 The Vertex of a crooked line is that point where the crooked line intersect the diameter or axis as at  
[3] 4 The Asymptote of crooked lines are such lines which being produced both ways infinitely have noe least distance twixt them & the crooked line & yet {doe} noe where intersect it. or touch it as  ,  .
[4] 5 Those lines which are limited on all sides as  are Ellipses of the first, 2d, 3d, 4th kind &c
6 Those which are not ellipses & have noe Asymptotes are Parabolas of the first, 2d, 3d, 4th kind &c. as  .
7 Those which have Asymptotes, are Hyperbolas of the 1st, 2d, 3d 4th kind, &c as (upon) whose asymptotes are  ,  .
8 There are some lines of a middle nature twixt a Parabola & hyperbola haveing an Asymptote for one of its sides but none for the other as  , one side  haveing the asymptote  , the other side  haveing none.
10 If an Ellipsis have 2 axes (as  &  ) the longer is the transverse axis (as  ) the shorter is the right axis (as  ).
9 If two diameters of the same Ellipsis be ordinately applyed the one to the other the shortest of them is called the right diameter, the longest the transverse one. (as  &  ).
1 If all the parallell lines which are terminated by the same or by 2 divers figures, bee bisected by a streight line; that bisecting line is a diameter, & those paralle{l} lines, are lines ordinately applied to that diameter.
2 If those parallell lines intersect the diameter at right angles the diameter is an axis
The center of an Ellipsis is that point where two of its diameters intersect.
The center of two opposite Hyperbolas is that point where two of their diameters intersect one another or else where their Asymptotes intersect.

Propositions. The lines ordinately applied to the axis of a crooked line are parallell to the tangent of the crooked line at its vertex.
[5] Demonstr. Suppose  a Parab &  (being ordinately applied to the axis  ) not parallell to the tangent  but to some other line like . If  bee understood to move towards   continually decreasing untill it vanish into nothing at the conjuction of the points  &  . & since  must be equall to  at the conjuntion of the points  &  . it followeth that  cannot decrease so as to vanish into nothing at the same time which  doth & therefore cannot allways be equal to  .
[6] Otherwise. if  is not parallell to the tangent  but to some other line as  . Then  doth not bisect all the parallell lines (as  ) which are terminated by the crooked line  . & therefore cannot bee its diameter
[7] 2dly. If  is the axis of a crooked line & , is ordinately applied to  . that is if  . Then  must be found noe where of odd dimensions in the Equation expressing the nature of the line . For (suppose{in}g  to be the unknowne quantity)  hath 2 valors  &  equall to one another excepting that the one  is affirmative, the other  is negative. which two valors cannot bee exprest by an equation in which  is of odd dimensions for suppose  . then is , since . & , since . &  therefore is , or . soe if . then is  , &  or  but if . then  . but not . soe if . then  but not . The same reason is cogent in compound equations. as if . Then, . where though the root  is affirmative & the roote  may bee negative yet they can never be equall in length, & though the 2 roots of an equation which differ in signes should bee equally long yet that is when the Equation is fully determined.
[8] Proposition 4th. If  is of more dimensions in a quantity not multiplied by  then in one multiplied by it (as in ) then  is not parallel to one of the lines Asymptotes. & e contra. Otherwise  &  are parallel to the Asymptotes of the line. et e contra.
Proposition 3d. If  is the Asymptote of the crooked line  , &  is coincident with it, & . then in the Equation (expressing the relation twixt  &  ,)  must bee multiplied by  wherever it is of its greatest dimensions. & if  is an asymptote to the line  , &  be parallel to it, &  terminated by it at the point  , then must  be multiplied by  wherever it is of its greatest dimensions. Example: Suppose . because in these 2 termes   is of its greatest dimensions; but in one of them (viz:  ) it is not multiplyed by  therefore  is not coincident with  the asymptote. If    . then since  is of its greatest dimensions in  &  onely & is drawne into  in both of them therefore  is coincident with the Asymptote{;} Also since  is of its greatest dimensions in  onely, (which {illeg} multiplied by  ) therefore  is parallel to  {illeg} {terminated} by an Asymptote. &c.
Demonstration If  is coincident with the Asymptote then {  } when  . i:e:  is infinite when {illeg} {wisheth}. Now suppose . then if  is  . i:e:  is {illeg} but if . then if  it is { }. soe {that}  is finite & therefor{e}{illeg} coincident with the {illeg} de{illeg}{illeg} of {illeg} is like{illeg}

[9] Haveing {an} the nature of a crooked line expresed in algebraicall termes to find its axes if {I}{i} {shave} {  }
[10] Draw a line infinitely both ways fix upon some point (as  ) for the begining of one of the unknowne quantitys (which I call  . Then reduce the Equation to such an order (if it bee not already so) that  may be always found in the line  . with one end fixed at  , & having  making right angles with it at the other end: that end of  which is remote from  , describing the crooked line. which may bee always done without any great difficulty. As may be perceived by these examples.
[11] Suppose the given Equation was  . soe that  .  .  being perpendicular to  & the angle  being given, the proportion twixt  &  is given, which I supose as  to  . then is   . &  .  . or  . &  . Or  .[12] Therefore I write  for  , &  for  in the equation  , & soe I have this equation  . which expresseth the relation twixt  &  , that is twixt  &  , writeing therefore  for  , &  for  : I have this equation 
[13] Soe if   turned about the pole  &   about the pole  describing the crooked line  by the conjunction at the extremitys. & the equation expresing the relation which they beare to one another is . the distance of the poles is given which I call  .[14] perpendicular to  I draw  & make  . Then, is   soe that for  I write . Or  . which expresseth the relation which  beareth to  , & by makeing  ,  , it is, .
Example 3d If  be always in the line  . &  turning about the pole  & passing by the end of  with its other end  describes the crooked line  , soe that calling    . then drawing  &  perpendicular to  .  , &  are given. & I make  {.}  . then is  .  .  . or by extracting the roote  . againe  . Or  . & by transposeing  to the other side & so squareing both parts  . which equation expresseth the relation twixt  , &   . & so by calling   , &   , it is,  .
Example 4th. if  turnes about the pole  , &  (a given line ) slides upon  with one end & intersecting  at right angles at the other end describes the crooked line  by its intersection with  . then makeing  ,  .   &  therefore  or  . & so by writing  for  &  for  , I have the relation twixt  &  exprest in this equation  .
Or if the relation twixt  &  was exprest in this equation (making  .  ) . then as before   therefore  . first therefore I take away  by making  . or by ordering it  . Then I take away  by substituteing its valor  into its roome & it will be  . & by squareing both parts.  . & by writeing  for  &  for  the equation will be  .
The like may as easily be performed in any other case.
After the equation is brought to this order observe that if  is noe where of odd dimensions then the line  (which is coincident with  ) is parte of an axis of the crooked line, as in the 2d Example. And if  is noe where of odd dimensions (as in this,  ) Then from the point  at the begining of  . I draw  perpendicular to  which is coincident with the axis of the crooked line. And if neither  nor  bee of unequall dimensions in any terme of the equation then both  &  may bee taken for axes of the crooked line or lin{e}s whose nature are expressed by the equation. As in the 4th Example.
But if  is of odd dimension{s} in the Equation then ordering the Equation according to  see if  is of eaven dimensions in the first te{r}me {illeg} {  } not found in the 2nd. if so take away the 2nd terme of the equation & if there result an Equation in which  is noe where of {odd} dim{en}sions. Then I draw  perpendicular to  & equall to that quantity which added or substracted from  that might take away the 2d terme; through the point {illeg} P{illeg} f{illeg}{illeg}{illeg}bee {illeg}.

[15] As in this Example, . Then to take away the 2d terme I make  . & soe I have,  . in which  is not of odd dimensions. Then drawing  for  ,  for  , &  for  : or which is the same (since  ) I make  that is I draw  &  on 2 contrary sides of the line  . & through the point  I draw  parallell to  & make it the axis of the line  
[16] Example the 2d.    . Then by making  I take away the 2d terme. & the Equation  . in which  is onely of eaven dimensions. Then I draw  for  .  for   for, or which is the same (since    ) I make  , that is I draw  &  on the same side of  then through the point  parallell to  I draw  for the axis of the lines   .
[17] In like manner, if  is of odd dimensions in some terme of the Equation, the Axis  perpendicular to  may bee found. As for Example.  {  }  . by makei{ng}  , I take away the 2d terme and soe have this equation  . therefore I draw  from the fixed point  , & , or which is the same (since  ) I draw  , that is I draw  &  on two contrary sides of the line  then throug{h} the point  , parallell to  I draw  the axis of the line
[18] Example 2d. . by makeing  I have this Equation . In which  is noe where of odd dimensions. therefore assumeing  for the begining of  & making , &   , or which is the same I make , since ; that is if  is affirmative I take  &  on the same side of the line  . otherwise I describe them on contrary sides of it. then through the point  parallell to  I draw  {an} axis of the lines  &  . Againe I order the Equation according to  & it is . & soe since  is not in the 2d terme makeing  . I take away the 2d terme, & it is . Therefore I draw  ,  , &  . or which differs not (since  ) I make  & through the point  parallell to  I draw {  } for another axis of the lines  , &  .
[19] But if the unknowne quantity (  or  ) is of odd dimensions in the first terme or if both the unknowne quantitys are in the 2d terme, or if by these meanes the equation is irreducible to such a forme that  , or,  , or both of them bee of odd dimensions noewhere in the Equation: Then try to find the axes by the following method. Observing by the way that
If  begins at the point  & extends towards  in the line  then  is taken the contrary way towards  , & all the affirmative lines parallell to  are drawne the same way which  is but the negative lines parallell to  are drawn the same way with  as if from the point  I must draw a line , I draw it towards  but if from the same point  I must draw a line  I draw it towards  . soe if from the point  I must draw  , then I draw it towards  , but if  then I draw it towards  . Againe if  is drawne toward  from the line  , then  is drawne from the same line  the contrary way towards  , & those lines which are affected with an affirmative signe & are parallell to  they are drawne the same way which  is but those lines which are negative are drawn the contrary way. as if  then I draw  towards  but if  then I draw it towards  . soe if  then I draw it from  towards , if  , I draw it towards .

The use of the precedent table in finding the Axes of crooked Lines, declared by Examples.
[31] Suppose I had this Equation given, . That I may find the axis of the line signified by it, first I observe of how many dimensions one of the unknowne quantities or the rectangle of them both is found at most in the Equation, (as in this Example they have noe more than 2) then I take every quantity in which one of the unknowne quantitys or the rectangle of them both is of soe many dimensions (which in this case are .) Then lookeing in the Table, (either amongst the rules of the first or 2d sort &c) for a rule in which the first quantity is of soe many dimensions I substitute the valors of the unknowne quantitys, found by that rule, into their place in the selected quantitys & supposeing the product , I find the proportion of  to  thereby, that is I find the angle which the axis makes with the unknowne quantity called  . As in this case I take the 2d Rule of the first sort, & by it I find . . . which valors substituting into the roome of the unknown quantitys in these selected termes . I have this equation. . or, . &  so that by assuming any quantity for  as  I have the valor of  , for  . therefore  &c. In the next place that I may find the length of the line  . I take another rule whose first quantity is not of soe many nor of fewer dimensions than one of the unknowne quantitys or the rectangle them both is some where in the Equation. Then select every quantity out of the Equation, the valor of whose unknowne quantity may be found by this rule, & substituting their valors, found thereby, into their places in these selected termes make the product . & find the valor of  thereby. As in this example I must take the first rule of the 1st sort. By which I find , , : but the valor of  cannot be found by it. therefore I onely take the termes , & by substituting the valors of the unknown quantitys into their roomes I have . Then by substituting the about found valors of  &  into their places, it is . Or . or . Soe that if I make  the beginning of  , &  to tend towards  in the line  , &  towards  perpendicularly to  . then must I draw  from the point  perpendicular to  ; &  , & parallell to  ; then   , & parallell to  . Lastly through the points  &  draw  the axis of the line sought. Otherwise it may be done thus  . therefore I take  , & through the points  &   . I draw  the axis sought.
[32] Example the 2d. If the Equation bee . the Rule whose first quantity is of as many dimensions as either of the unknowne quantitys in this Equation, is the 3d of the first sort or the first of the 2d sort. Selecting therefore onely  out of the Equation (since in neither of these rules the valor of  is found) by the 3d rule of the first sort I find  ,  . therefore the selected termes  . &  . Or,  . In like manner by the first rule of the 2d sort tis found  .  . & therefore   . & . Or  as before. Soe that  . therefore  . Now that I may find  I take the 2d Rule of the first sort (whose first quantity  is of fewer dimensions than  or  but not of fewer  ,) The quantitys in the Equation whose valors are expressed in this rule are  , &  for  .  . Soe that I write  instead of . soe that  . Or since  , it is,  . Had I taken the first rule of the first sort I had found . &  . therefore  which is right since  . but by this equation  hath other valors for  or  , &  . &c. Whence observe that for the most {part} it will bee most convenient to find  by that rule whose 1st quantity hath one dimension lesse than the first quantity of that rule by which the proportion twixt  &  were found.
<20r>
Example the 3d. If the Equation be .  being of 4 dimensions I take the 4th rule of the first sort, or the 2d rule of the 2d sort. By the 4th rule of the 1st sort I find  & since by that rule I can find the valor of noe other quantity in the Equation I make . Which is divisible by  , &  , & by  . therefore either  ; or,  ; or,  . The operation is the same if I make use of the 2d rule of the 2d sort. Againe I take the 3d rule of the 1st sort & by it I find, .  . therefore &  . therefore  . Or . & if , then  . or  is infinitely long. but if  . then  . & if  , then . Againe I take the first rule of the 2d sort & by it I find . .  . therefore  Now if . or if , then the termes of this Equation destroy one another soe that the valor of  may not be found thereby. but if , then I find . Or . Or . Againe I take the 2d rule of the 1st sort & by it I find . If  then . or  . that is  is infinitely long as was found before. also it may bee found to bee  , or  but upon this supposition  it was not before found  & therefore  is false, when  . If  . then I find . or  . &c. If  . then . . Which valor not being found before I conclude  to bee false. Lastly by useing the first rule of the first sort I find,  . & by supposeing  I have {  }. &  . & if  , then  which being always found upon the supposition . I conclude the valor of  to be  & of  to be  . & so draw the axis  parallell to  & distant from it the length of  . But here observe that this might have beene better performed by taking away the 2d terme of the Equation . Or  as was observed before.

[33]To find the Diameter or axis of any crooked line which hath it
[34] Suppose the crooked line to bee  , the diameter or Axis  , the undetermined quantitys describing the line to be , . from the point  (the begining of ), perpendicular to  draw , cutting the axis  in  . parallell to  draw . & produce  soe that it intersect the axis in the point  . & suppose that  is to  . as  to  : or that  . & therefore . let   be one of those lines which are ordinately applied to the diameter  . lastly suppose that  is to  as  is to  : then is  ; &   then .   & . & by ordering the Equation it will be,   . Againe,  . & ,  or by substituteing the valor of  into its place it is  . And that I may abbreviate the termes I make  ; &  ; & so the Equation is  . Also by supposeing , I lessen the termes of the Equation  , by writeing instead .
Now therefore by substituting these valors of  &  into their stead I take them out of the Equation expressing the relation twixt them soe that then I have an equation expressing the relation twixt  &  . And to that end it will bee convenient to have a table of the squares, cube, squaresquares, square=cubs, rectangles &c of the valors of  &  , After the manner of that which follows.
 .  . . . . &c. . . . . . &c . . . &c. . .  . &c 
As for example. If the relation twixt  &  bee exprest in this Equation,  . then into the place of  ,  ,  ,  , I substitute their valors found by this table, & there results . Which Equation expresseth the relation twixt  &  . that is twixt  &  or  . Now that  be the diameter &  be ordinately applied to it, it is required (by Prop 2d) that in this Equation  be not of odd dimensions. & that may bee soe the quantitys in the 2d terme which  is {illeg} of {illeg} must {illeg} one another which cannot be unlesse these quantitys destroy one another in which the unknowne quantitys  &  {illeg}are of the {same} <21v> dimensions. Which things being considered it will appeare that I must divide the 2d terme into two parts, makeing, ; &,  . & divideing the first by  & the 2d by  they will be,  . Hitherto useing the letters  ,  , &  for brevitys sake, I must now write their valors in theire stead (that I may find the length of  , & the proportion of  to  which determine the position of the axis, & also the proportion of  to  which determines the position of the lines applyed to the axis.) & soe {instead} of the Equation  ; there results,  . & by squareing both parts & ordering the product it is,  . Which is divisible by  , for the quote will bee  . & therefore  . Or,  . Againe by inserting the valors of  &  into the Equation,  , there resulteth,  . & by writing  instead of  & divideing it by  there resulteth  Or  . Thus haveing found the proportion of  to  , & the valor of  since there remaines noe more equations by which I may find the proportion of  to  I concluded it to be undetermined, soe that I may assume any proportion betwixt them. As if I make  . Then the angle  is a right one &  the axis of the line, &  . &  . or  . that is  ; As in the 1st figure.[35] Or if I make  . that is  . or  , then I find that  . that is that the diameter  intersects the line  at the point  the begining of  . & that the lines  are parallell to  as in the 2d figure[36] &c. Soe that by assumeing any proportion twixt  &  , that is, supposeing the angle  of any bigness, the position of the diamiter  , may be found after the same manner. As If I would have the angle  to be an angle of  degrees. then must  be double to  , &  . i.e. . & , therefore . I found before that  . or writeing the valor of  in its roome, tis  that is  . Or since  must be lesse than  it must . &  since  . As in the 3d figure.[37] But if I would make the angle  of  degrees then as before  , & , &  , or since  must be greater than  tis  , as in the 4th fig. &c.[38]

[39] To find the Axis or Diameter of any crooked Line supposeing it have them.
[40] [41] [42] Suppose  ;  ;  the line whose axis or Diameter is sought;  its axis or Diameter;  its vertex;  lines ordinately applied to its Diameter;  a perpendicular to  drawne from the point  , i.e. from the begining of  ;  parte of the line  intercepted twixt the diameter &  ;  a line parallell to  & drawne from  to the intersection of  &  ; &  & parallell to  ; &  a right angled triangle.  &, .
Then  . &,  . Againe   . &,  ; or,  .
Now therefore by substituteing  into the place of  , &  into the place of  , & theire squares & cubes &c: into the place of  ,  ,  &c. I take  & {  } out of the Equation expressing the relation twixt them & Soe have an Equation expressing the relation twixt  &  . And to that end it will be convenient to have a table of the squares, cubes, & rectangles &c: of the valors of  &  , like that which follows.
 


As for example if the relation twixt  &  bee exprest by,  then in stead of  , {  },  ,  , writeing their valors found by this table there resulteth { .} Which equation espresseth the relation twixt  &  when any valors are assumed for  ,  ,  , &  . And if the valors of  ,  ,  , &  bee such that  is not of odd dimensions in the Equation (that is that the 2d terme of this Equation be wa{illeg}) then (by Prop: the 2d)  is ord{illeg} <24r> is ordinately applyed to the Diameter  .Now that the 2d terme of this Equation vanish it is necessary that those termes destroy one another in which the unknowne quantitys  &  are not diverse nor differ in dimensions. Whence it appeares that I must divide the 2d terme into 2 parts making . &  . Or by divideing the first of these by  , & the 2d by . they are,  , &  . The first being divided by  . there results,  . Therefore one or both these propositions  ;  , is trew. by the 2d tis found that  . Now since by assumeing some quantitys for the valors of  ,  , or  I cannot find the valor of  unless by the Equation . therefore I conclude  . whence it is not necessary that  , or the proportion of  to  bee limited soe that by assuming the angle  of any bigness I may find the position of the axis  . As if I suppose the angle  to be a right one (i.e. that  is the axis of the line) then are the triangles  &  alike, & therefore  . &  . Or because  . therefore  . &  . Soe that I draw . &  parallell to   & parallell  & through the points  &  I draw  the axis of the line  , as in figure 1st[43] So if I would have  parallell to  i.e. the angle  of 45 degrees. then this evident that  . & . Threfore through the point  I draw the axis  , so that  , as before. &c. & note that since  the axis is always parallell to it selfe the line  is a parabola.[44]
[45] Example the 2d, . Being first to write the valors of  &  (found by the precedent table) into their roome, since I have noe neede of those termes in which  is of eaven dimensions I leave them out, & soe for  I write onely . Then sorting these quantitys together in which the unknowne quantitys are the same there these 4 Equations (the 1st being divided by  , the 2d by  , the 3d by  , the 4th by  ) viz:  ;  ;  ;  . In the first Equa tion , I extract the cube roote & tis . or . In the 2d  ,  , or . By the 3d,  , or  . & so by the fourth.[46] Now therefore since    . In the line  from some point as  perpendicular to  I draw  ,  . then from the points  &  through  I draw the line  which (since it cuts the lines  applied to them at right angles) is axis of the lines  which appeares in that , for therefore  , soe that  &  perpen dicular to  .
[47] Example 3d If the nature of the given line bee expressed in these termes  . Then by supplanting the valors of  &  into theire roome & working as before, there will bee,  . & 2dly  . & 3dly  . & 4tly,  . The first of these divided by  . is  . Or squareing & ordering the product tis . Which being  . there results  . Wherefore I conclude one of these 3 to be the valors of  viz: . Now that I may know which of those is the right valor of  I try them singly, & first suppose  ; If so then by the 4th Equation , therefore . If  , then in the 3d Equation all the termes vanish except  : therefore  . & since  , all the termes in the 2d Equation vanish except  except  , therefore also  , which since it ought not to bee I conclude that  is false. Therefore I passe the 2d valor of  , or, . & soe divideing the 4th Equation by  {i{t}} results  . which is divisible by  & by  , Now that I may know which is the right valor of  first I suppose  : & soe all the termes in the Equation vanish except,  . or, {  . } & since  , by the 2d Equation tis  or  . {Which things since} they agree I conclude that  , or ;  ;  . Since  {illeg} {illeg} must be parallell to  & {illeg}  {illeg} must bee {coincident} with it. then {illeg} the axis {  I take some {illeg} {illeg} } & fro{illeg} perpendicular {illeg} {illeg} {illeg}the {illeg}

Then for readiness in these operations make a table of the squares, cubes, rectangles, &c of these valors of  &  . As was done before 
[51] Example If the relation twixt  &  be expressed by . then by inserting those quantitys (of the valors of  &  found by this table) in which  is of odd dimensions, into place of  ,  ,  ,  in this Equation, & supposeing those to destroy one another which are multiplied by the same unknowne quantitys there will bee these 2 Equations , & ∼ .

[54] Haveing the Diameter to find the Vertex of the line.
[55] Suppose , or .  or .  . . that is . soe that into the given equation I insert this valor of  or of  into the place of  or (which may more readily bee done). 
[56] As in the first example I found   & the proportion twixt  &  to bee unlimited so that if I would  to bee the Axis I make . (vide C) or . & there I found  . or since  it is  . As may bee seene in that example. Now that I may find the vertex of the line was there exprest in these termes. . I suppose . that is  . or  . or  . & writeing this valor of  into its roome in the Equation ; there results  . or  . Therefore from the point  I draw  . & from the point  I draw the perpendicular  until it {cut}{cutt} the axis  , that is, soe that . & the point  shall bee the vertex of the Parabola  .
[57] Soe in the 2d Example of the line  , it was found  . & . & therefore  . or  . therefore I write  for  in the Equation . & it is  . or  . therefore I take  & soe draw the perpendicular  , which shall intersect the axis  at the vertex of the crooked line. [58] & then (calling  ) it shall be . Soe that in this case .
[59] In the 3d Example the Equation being , It was found, . . that is  . therefore  . Therefore by writeing  instead of  in the Equation all the termes vanish except ∼  , or  . &  . soe that the vertex of the line  must bee at the point  .
[60] But in the 4th Example,  . It was found { }{}. or . &  was unlimited, I make therefore  . & since the axis is perpendicular to  therefore I insert the valor of  into the equation  & there results . or  . Wherefore I conclude the vertex of the line to be infinitely distant from  towards .
[61]  If the position of any line (as  ) be given the point where it intersects the given crooked line  may be found by the same manner; for suppose ∼  or  .  or  . &  . . . . angles  ,  ,  right ones; then, to find the point  where the crooked line  is intersected by the line  , I suppose . that is,  . or  . & since by the nature of the line  . it follows that  . &  . & by extracting the rootes of them. both,  . &  . therefore I take  . &  .
By the same manner the intersection by 2 crooked lines may be found.

[62] Having the nature of any lines expressed in Algebraicall termes, to find its Asymptotes if have any
[63] Suppose  , &  the asymptotes of the line  . &  parallel to  drawne from the Asymptote to the line  . . . . .  .  . the angles  ,  ,  ,  ,  , to bee right ones. then is, . . . . & . Now for readiness in operation it bee convenient to have a table of these valors of  &  which will bee the same with that by which the diameters of crooked lines are determined. viz.   This table may be continued when the nature of the lines are expressed by Equations of 4 or more dimensions. This like the former rules will be beste perceived by Examples than precepts. As
Example the 1st. To find the asymptotes of the line whose nature is exprest by  . first I write the valors of  ,  &  (found by this table) into theire places in the Equation . & there results . or by ordering it, . Or, . Now by assumeing any valors for  ;  ,  ;  ,  . I have, by this equation, the relation which  beares to  , that is which  beares to  . But that the valors of  ,  ,  ,  &  , may be such that  (to which  is applyed) may be one asymptote &  parallell to the other, it is necessary (by Proposition 3d) that neither  nor  bee any where of soe many or of more dimensions, then in those termes in which they multiply one another. Therefore I consider of how many dimensions  is at the most in any terme multiplied by , & how many  is in any terme multiplied by  ; & find them but of one. & therefore conclude that  &  ought to be found in noe terme in this equation ∼ unlesse where they multiply one another. [64][65] Moreover tis manifest that the Equation (expresing the nature of the given line) will ever be of one & but of one dimension more than  or  in some termes in which they multiply one another: & therefore this may bee put for a Generall Rule viz. All those termes must destroy one another in which there is not  & which are of as many, or want but one dimension of being of as many dimensions as the Equation is. Now that these termes destroy one another, tis necessary that those be  in which the unknowne quantitys  &  are the same. Upon which considerations it will appeare that in this example I must make,  . 2dly,  . thi{rdly} { }. 4thly  . Or by dividing them by those quantitys which {neede} {illeg}  . they are  . 2dly  . thirdly,  . 4thly,  . by the 3d,  . & since tis not  , by the first  . by the 2d  . or {  }. by the 4th  .

[68] Or thus. If . . .  &  perpendiculars to the crooked line  which intersect at the point  . . . the angles  ,  ,  ,  right ones.
Suppose , expresseth the relation twixt  &  . First I find the length of  (see folium 8th hujus, or Des=Cartes his Geometry pag 40) which is . . . . Or . Out of these termes first I take away  by writeing its valor in its roome which in this case is  & there results, .

Now tis Evident that when the lines  &  are coincident that  is the radius of a circle which hath the same quantity of crookednesse which the Parabola  hath at the point  .

[69][70] The crookednesse of equall portions of circles are as their diameters, reciprocally.
Demonstration. The crookednesse of any whole circle (  ,  ) amounts to 4 right angles, therefore there is as much crookednesse in the circle  as in  . Now supposing the perimeter  is equall to the arch  , Then as the arch  is to the circumference  , soe is the crookednesse of the arch  to the crookednesse of the perimeter  , or of  . so is  to  .

To find the Quantity of crookednesse in lines[71]
[72] Suppose  &  perpendiculars to the crooked line  , which intersect one another at  . . . . . . & the angles  ,  , ,  right ones. Then, . . Or .
Haveing therefore the relation twixt  &  (as if it be ) first I find the valor of  ( see Cartes Geometry pag 40th. or folium 8th of this) (as in this Example tis ) by which I take  out of the Equation , (& in this case there results .) then by meanes of the Equation expressing the relation twixt  &  I take out either  or  , which may easliest bee done (as in this example I take out  by writeing  in its stead & there results  . Or  . & by squareing both parts  ) Then if I assume any valors for  &  that is if I determine the point  , I have an Equation by which I can find all the perpendiculars to the crooked line, drawne from the point  . for if I tooke  out of the Equation, the rootes of the Equation will bee all such lines as are drawn from the points of intersection  ,  ,  ,  , to the line  (as  ,  , &c) but if I tooke  out of the Equation then the roots of the Equation will bee those lines drawne from  to the perpendiculars (as  ,  , &c. Now by how much the nigher the points  &  are to one another, soe much the lesse difference there will bee twixt the crookednesse of the parte of the line  , & a circle described by the radius  or  . And should the line  be understood to move untill it bee coincident with  , taking  for the point where they ceased to intersect at theire coincidence, the circle described by the radius  , & the crooked line at the point  , would bee alike crooked. And when the 2 lines  &  are coincident 2 of the rootes of the Equation (viz  &  ,  &  ) shall bee equall to one another; Wherefore to find the crookednesse of the line at the point  I suppose the equation to have 2 equall rootes & so ordering it According D: Cartes or Huddenius his Method, the valor of any of these 3 {  }   being given, the valor of the other 2 may be found. [73] (as in this Example the valor of  being given I multiply the Equation according to Huddenius method & it is  [74] Then by divideing both the numerators by  & the denominators by , & so multiplying them {in crucem} & ordering the product it is. {}.
Now considering that if  ,  , &  bee known, that is, if the Ellipsis  be determined, & the line  given{,} there are onely two points in the line (viz:  &  ) to be considered. And the valors of  are (  ,  ,  ) {such} lines as are drawne from the line  to the points where the perpendiculars   intersect (as  ) or to such points where two perpendiculars (as  &  ) {ceased} to intersect at theire coincidence into one (as  &  ). Therefore {illeg}of the first {illeg} roots I get the valor of the {line} . as {illeg} this Equation by {illeg} that is  {illeg} ; {illeg} there results <31v> .[75] That is dividi{ng} it by ; . Which Equation expresseth the length of the lines (, & ) which are drawne from the line  to the points  &  at which the coincident perpendiculars last intersected one another before theire coincidence. Now haveing the length of  or  it will not be difficult to find, , or, ; for it was found before that  Or  . Likewise it will not bee difficult to find  or  , for (supposeing  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  . . or ) it is, , Lastly the circle described with the radius  shall have the same quantity of crookedness which the Ellipsis hath at the point  .
[76] Example the 2d. Were I to find the quantity of crookedness at some given point of the line exprest by  ; I might consider that it differs from the former Example onely in that there I have  or  , here  , that is in the former  was negative in this is affirmative. Soe that this operation will bee the same with the former the signe of  being changed soe that it will be found   or  . &c as before.
[77] Example the 3d. In the Parabola, . & . In the above mentioned Equation  I take out  by write{ing}  in its roome & it is . then I take out  by writeing  in its stead . & by squareing both sides, . Which is an equation haveing 2 equall roots & therfore multiplied according Huddenius his method soe that  be blotted out, & the result divided by  it is, . Now tis evident that  being determined there are 2 points (viz:  &  ) from which perpendiculars being drawne they intersect one another in the axis at  , wherefore ∼  is one of the rootes of the Equation & therefore it being divided by , or by  there results  Or . Then into the above found Equation ∼ ∼ , I substitut this valor of  & there results .  . Soe that I have . And  . & therefore  shall be the Radius of a circle which is as crooked as the Parabola at the point  .
[78] Or it might have beene done thus, haveing the Equation , I might have written  in stead of  , & soe have had  which must have 2 equall roots & therefore by the Method de maximis & minimis I {blott} out  & there results, . Or, . makeing , . . . . now if  bee determined it is manifest that there is but one point of the Parabola (viz: ) to bee considered from which the perpendiculars which are drawne doe noe where intersect one another & therefore this equation hath not superfluous rootes like the former.
[79] Example the 4th. If it bee supposed that the nature of the line is contained in . & if tis  .  . .  &  2 perpendiculars to the crooked line, , &  two points where the coincident perpendiculars last intersected  . . Then is  . by which I take  out of the above named Equation  , & the result being divided by  , it is,  Or ({illeg} : Then I substitute this valor of  into its place in Equation  & there results . or by ordering it {it} will bee {{illeg} } Which Equation must have {illeg}

<32r>

two equall roots & therefore by ordering it according to Huddenius Method de Maximis & Minimis, I blot out the last terme & the result is  . Or  . By what was said before tis evident that the perpendicular  drawne from the line  to the point where the two perpendiculars intersect, is one of the rootes of this Equation.
[80] And that I may have a general rule to find the line  (or had there beene 3 or more perpendiculars, to find all those lines which are drawne from the line  to every intersection of the perpendiculars) I consider that if  be not drawne from the line  to the point of intersection ; then  hath two valors as  but if they bee drawne to the point , that is, if they be ∼ coincident with  ; then the two roots of  are equall to one ∼ another, being the same with the line  . Likewise if  be drawne from the line  to the perpendiculars  ,  {illeg} but not from the point where they ∼ intersect; then hath  two roots (as  ,  ) which will also be equall to one ∼ another & coincident with the line  , when  is the same with  . This being considered; if I would the valor of  , I must order the affore found Equation (in which  was supposed to have 2 equall roots) according to  & it will bee  . which must have 2 equall roots & therefore by Huddenius Method de Maximis & Minimis I take away the last terme & Soe I have, ; or, : But if I would have the valor of  I order the Equation according to the letter  & it is . which Equation must likewise have two equall roots & therefore takeing away the last terme by Huddenius method de Maximis & Minimis there resulteth this, . Or  & this  is one of the rootes of the Equation , which was required, therefore I must divide this equation by . that is by  , & there will result,  . That is . Whence it will not be difficult to find the points  &  & ∼ consequently the lines  ,  which shall be the radij of circles which have the same quantity of crookednesse the line  hath at the points  &  . Makeing {  }.

Note that the crooked line  (described by the points  &  ) is always touched by the (perpendicular)  ; & that in such sort as to bee measured by it{,} they applying themselves the one to the other, point by point; soe that if  the shortest of all the lines  be substracted from  there remaines  . By this meanes the length of as many crooked lines may bee found as is desired

[83] The Crookednesse in lines may bee otherwise found as in the following Examples
[84] In the Parabola  suppose  the point where the crookednesse is sought for, & that  is the center &  the Radius of a Circle equally crooked with the Parabola at  . Then naming the quantitys . . . . By the nature of the line . . {}. , That is,  which Equation must have 2 equall rootes that  may be perpendicular to the Parabola & therefore multiplyed according to Huddenius's Method it produceth . Which Equation hath soe many rootes as there can be drawn perpendiculars to the Parabola from the determined point  . And two of these rootes must become equall, that  may bee the center of the required Circle, therefore this equation is to bee multiplyed againe, & it will produce  that is . Or  : As was found in the 3d precedent example.
[85] Here observe that in the 1st of these 3 Equations  hath 4 valors  ,  ,  &  . see fig 2d when  ;  , &  are determined. But  ,  , &  being determined  hath but one valor . And if  ,  , &  bee determined then  hath 2 valors  & . And ,  , &  being determined  hath 2 valors  &  as that first equation denotes by the dimensions of the quantitys in it.  By the 2d of these Equations 2 of the valors of  are united by the increasing or diminishing the valor of  &c. first suppose the circle soe little as noe where to intersect the Parabola, it being increased gradually will first touch the Parabola at  (fig 3d) then ceasing to touch it it intersects it in 2 points  &  (fig 2d) which two points grow more distant untill it touch the Parabola in  (fig 3d) which being divided into two intersection points  &  (fig 2d) the points  &  draw nearer untill they conjoyne in the touch point  & soe the circle ceaseth (by still increasing) to touch the Parabola or intersect it unlesse in  &  . Whence from one point  may be drawne 3 perpendiculars  ,  ,  , to the Parabola  . And therefore in this 2d Equation  must have 3 valors  ,  , &  , when , & , are determined then also hath  three valors  ,  , &  .
By the 3d Equation Two of the valors of  in the 2d Equation are united by incresing or diminishing the length of . For begining at the point at the point  (from which the 3 perpendiculars fall upon  ,  &  ) if the point  doth gradually move from  , the perpendicular  moves from  towards  Soe that the two perpendiculars =  &  will at last conjoyne into one  , Which shall be the Radius of a Circle as crooked as the Parabola at  .
This 3d operation might have beene done by making  determined & by = increasing or diminishing  . That is by destroying the term  in stead of  in the 2d Equation. And so might the 2d Operation beene done otherwise by determining the circle  , Or taking  or  out of the 1st Equation instead of  .
[86] There is another way of finding the crookednesse in lines & that is not by supposing two perpendiculars (  &  , or  &  ). but 3 intersections of a circle with the figure, (fig 2d  ,  ,  : or  ,  &  ). And then shall  have 3 equall valors  Or  . As if (in the last example I had this equation  . Supposing it to have 3 equall rootes by Huddenius his method tis  . (Which equation doth not determine the perpendiculars to  ) as  doth for by {  }. this I can find the valor of  (  being determined) but by it I {illeg} neither find the valor of {  } nor till one of them is taken out of the Equation). That Equation multiplyed {illeg} the dimensions of  produceth  Or { {illeg}{illeg} }.
[87] The same may be done thus. If a circle touch a crooked line at one point & intersect it {illeg}er when two points come together that circle {illeg} to {illeg} or {illeg}
As if . { . {illeg} {illeg}{illeg}. {illeg}  . }. {{illeg}  {illeg} . {illeg} may ever bee {illeg}). Then {illeg}} {{illeg}  . Or  {illeg}.} Or  {illeg} Or, {illeg}  {illeg} which cannot {illeg} T{illeg} by the {illeg} perpendiculars {illeg} by supposeing the circle described by the Radius {illeg}  & {illeg} to {illeg}

[88] Haveing found (by the former rule) an Equation by which the quantity of crookednesse in any line may bee found to find the greatest or least crookednes of that line.
[89] In the 4th Example I had found  . And by a rule there shewed viz {}: It was there found . Now by writeing  in stead of  & ordering the product according to the letter  it is . Or extracting the roote it is  Also by the nature of the line, . Therefore  . Also  . And Since  Therefore   ; Supposing  The roote of the Surde quantity extracted the Equation is . Or . In which Equation the least valor of  is to bee found & that should happen when  hath 2 equall valors or rootes. But because  being determined  can have but one valor  the other 2 rootes being imaginary tis impossible that it should have 2 equall rootes: Therefore I take away  out of the Equation by substituting its valor  in its stead & there results . In which equation  or  being determined  hath 2 valors  &  the other foure being imaginary & when  is the longest or shortest that may bee then these two valors become one & then is the line  more or least crooked. If therefore (that  's valors become equall) this Equation is multiplyed according to its dimensions there will result  . which is divisible by  , or by  (for there results  ). And if  , then is  . Therefore I take  &  & at the point  shall bee the least crookednesse.
Here may bee noted Huddenius his mistake, that if some quantity in an equation designe a maximum or minimum that Equation hath two equall rootes which is false in the equation . & in all other equations which have but one roote.
Another way. May 1665
[90] Or because the lines  &  described by the points  &  doe touch one another points  from which points onely lines drawne perpendicular to the crooked line  will bee perpendicular to the point of greatest or least crookednesse: And also since all those are points of greatest or least crookedness to which such perpendiculars are drawne: The difficulty will be to find the point  . Now suppose that  be determined then  hath two valors for  . And alsoe  hath two valors for  . Alsoe (when  is not parallell to the axis of the line)  hath two (or more) valors  . which valors of  ,  , or  become equall if  : by which meanes the point  may bee found: Excepting onely when  ,  , are parallel to the crooked line at  ({  }{)} [91] that is, perpendicular to the streightest or most crooked partes of the line  . But if  be determined, then    (but if  is parallel to the axis of the line the two valors of  are equall & soe not usefull). Which valors of  , , &  become equall if  : excepting onely when  is perpendicular to the most streight or crooked parts of the line  .
[92] As for example. In the precedent example it was found  . But because  or  is parallell to the axis of the line, Therefore substitute either the valors of  or of  into their stead. As if I substitute the valor of  into its place it will bee  or . which must have 2 equall roots & therefore multiplyed according to  's dimensions tis  . Or  as before. But if I had substituted  's valor into its stead it would have beene  which {illeg}ving 2 equall roots being rightly ordered is  . Or  . Or  . Or  , as before.
{In the first} Example of finding the quantity of crookednesse in lines the {illeg} found {  {illeg}  }. which {must} have 2 equall rootes & therefore by Hudde{nius} method it is {{illeg}}. Or,  .{illeg} That is  . or  {illeg}  Or {illeg}  {illeg}  {illeg} that if I take {  } & {illeg}  {illeg}  {illeg} the points {illeg} the greatest or least crookednesse {illeg} the line {illeg} {illeg} crookednesse which {illeg} found

The points of greatest or least crookednesse may bee yet otherwise found by an equation of 4 equall rootes. As in the example of the 2d way of finding the quantity of crookedness in lines it was found  . which being compared with an equation like it  . by the 2d terme tis  , or  . &  .

But here observe that unlesse the reflecting line  bee drawne through the point  the center of motion in the whole body  the determination of the motion of  will not be the same with the determination of the motion of  before reflection (as in the first figure[96]) but verge from it (as in the 2d fig[97]) that is  &  will not bee parallell. For since the chiefe resistan{ce} of the body  is from its center of motion (prop 32) from  towards  , & not from  towards  , the body  will find more opposition on that side towards the center  , then on the other side towards  & therefore at its reflection it must incline toward  (axiom 120) & not returne in the line  . But if the body  presse  towards  then  presseth the body  towards the contrary parte as from  towards  (axiom 119) & not from  towards , if .

39 If the body  reflect on the immoveable surface  at its corner  (fig 4th[99]) its parallell motion (viz from  to  ) shall not bee hindered by the surface  , (viz: if the center of  's motion were distant from the perpendicular  an inch at one minute before reflection it shall bee so far distant from it one minute after reflection). For  is noe ways opposed to motion parallell to it, & a body might  upon it without looseing any motion, & if at the first moment of contact the body  should loose its perpendicular & onely keepe its parallel motion it would (perhaps) continue to slide upon it & not reflect.
40 The body  reflecting on the plaine  at its corner  all its points in the perpendicular line  shall move from the plaine  with the same velocity which before reflection they moved to it. For the point  (prop 9) moves with that velocity backwards which it before did forwards (viz to  ) & all the other points (prop 38) move with the same velocity from it.

[2] 2 In the description of any Mechanicall line what ever, there may bee found two such motions which compound or make up the motion of the point describeing it, whose ∼ motion being by them found by the Lemma, its determinacon shall bee in a tangent to the mechanicall line.
[3] Example the 1st. If  is an helix, described by the point  the line  increasing uniformely whilest it also circulates uniformely about the center  Let the radius of the circle  bee . & let { } measure the quantity of the giration of  (viz  touching the helix at the center) let  be a tangent to the circle  . then is the motion of the point  towards  to its motion towards  , as  , to  . therefore make . & (by the Lemma) the diagonall  shall touch the helix in . Or make . & . the diagonall  shall touch the helix. (the length of  may be thus found viz; .)
[4] Example the 2d. If the center  of a globe  moves uniformely in a streight line parallel to , whilest the Globe uniformely girates. Each point  in the Globe will describe a Trochoides: to which a the point  I thus draw a tangent. Draw the radii  &  perpendicular to it then is the circular motion of the point  determined in the line  , & its progressive in  . If therefore I make  to  as the circular motion of the point  to its progressive the Diagonall (by the Lemma)  shall touch the Trochoides in  . As if the Globe roule upon the plaine  , & I make . & . then doth the Diagonall  touch the Trochoides. (Or  , passing through the point in which the globe & plaine touch, is a perpendicular to the {Trochoides}.
[6] [Scholium. The tangents of Geometricall lines may be found by their descriptions {after} the same manner. As the Ellipsis (whose foci are  &  ) being described by the thred  the thred  lengthens so much as the thred  shortens, or the point  moves equally from  & to . Therefore I take . & . & the diagonall  will touch the Ellipsis in  ]. (This should follow the 3d Example's substitute) See folium 57.
[7] Although the nature of a Mechanicall line is not knowne from its description but from some other principle yet may a tangent be drawne to it by the same method.
As if  is an Hyperbola.  its asymptote &  . & . to draw a tangent to the line  , I consider that,  increasing of   increasing of   increase of   increase of   motion of the point  towards   motion of  towards  , if . Therefore I make {} . & the diagonall  or  shall touch the line  . Or if  . . . . then doth  touch the line  at  .
Tangents to mechanicall lines may sometimes bee found by finding such a point which is immoveable in respect of the line described & also doth {{illeg}vary} in distance from the describing point. for the {Sicunf{illeg}} through that point. Thus in the Trochoides when the point  toucheth the plaine  tis immoveable, & tis ever equidistant from the describing point  ({illeg} both of them fin{illeg} points in the Globe). Therefore the line {illeg} drawne {from} the describeing point to the touch point of the Globe & plaine  is perpendicular to {the} trochoides. But in the spirall though the point {illeg} is {illeg} from that {illeg}.
[8] Instead {in the} third example {illeg} {illeg} {illeg}. <51r> Therefore  absolute & whole motion of  towards  (or  )  whole motion of  towards  (or  ). Soe that makeing . {} & . The point  will be moved to the line  &  in same times which cannot bee unlesse it move to  (their common intersection). The point  therefore move in the line  which doth therefore touch the Quadratrix at  : (The same is done by makeing  . & drawing the tangent  through the common intersection of  &  .)

To resolve Problems by motion the 6 following propositions are necessary & suffcient.
May 16. 1666.
[13] If the body  in the perimeter of the circle or sphære  moveth towards its center  . its velocity to each point  of that circumference is as the cordes  ,  ,  , drawne from that body to those points are.
Prop 2. If the triangles  ,  are alike though in diverse planes; & 3 bodys move from the point  uniformely & in equall times, the first to  , the 2d to  , the 3d to  : then is the 3d's motion compounded of the motion of the 1st & {2d.}
Note that by a body is meant its center of gravity.
Prop. 3. All the points of a body keeping parallel to it selfe are in equall motion.
Prop. 4. If a body onely move circularly about some axis, the motion of its points are as their distances from that axis.                     Call these 2 simple motions
Prop. 5. If the motion of a body is considered as mixed of simple motions: the motions of all its points are compounded of their simple motions, so as the motion towards  (in prop 2d) is compounded of the motion towards  &  .
Note that all motion is reducible to one of these 3 cases: & in the 3d case any line may bee taken for {the} axis (or if a line or superficies {move} in plano any point of that plaine may bee taken for the center) of motion.
[14] Prop. 6. If the lines {illeg}  being moved doe continually intersect; I describe the Trapezium  {illeg} its diagonall  : & say that the proportion & position of these five lines  ,  ,  ,  ,  being determined by {requisite data} they shall designe the proportion & position of these 5 motions: {illeg} of the point  fixed in the {illeg} moveing towards  ; of the point  fixed in the line  {illeg} moveing towards  ; of the intersection point  moveing in the plaine  towards  (for those 5 lines are {illeg} in the same plaine though {illeg} &  may only touch the plaine in their intersection point): of the intersection point  moveing in the line  parallely to  & according to the order of the letters  ,  : & of the {inter}section point  moveing in the line  parallelly to  & according to the order of those {illeg}
[15] Note that a streight line is said to designe the position of curved motion in any point {illeg} if toucheth the line described by the motion in that point, (as  ,  ,  ), or {illeg} tis parallell to such a {illeg} (as  , {illeg}). Note also that one line  resting (as in Fig 3 & 4) the points  &  are coincident & the point  shall bee in the line  if {illeg} bee streight (fig 3), otherwise in its tangent  (fig 4) {illeg}. Haveing an equation expressing the relation of two lines  &  described by two bodys  &  whose motions {illeg}  ; Translate {illeg} the termes to one side & multiply them, being ordered according to  {illeg} {illeg} progression { } &c: & being ordered by the dimensions of  multiply those by {illeg} {illeg} &c. the summa of those products {illeg} equation expressing the relation {illeg} {illeg} motions  &  .
<51v>
To draw a tangent to the Ellipsis
[16] Suppose the Ellipsis to be described by the thred  , & that  is its tangent. Since the thred  is diminished with the same velocity that be increaseth, that is, that the point  hath the same motion towards  &  , the angles  ,  , must bee equall, by prop 1. And, so of the other {conicks}.
To draw a Tangent to the Concha.
[17] Suppose that  ,  ,  are the rulers by which the concha is usually described, & that  , & . And (since equality is more simple than proportionality) suppose that  is the velocity of the point  towards  , or of  towards  . Then is  the circular motion of the point  about  (prop 1); &  the circular motion of the point  fixed in the ruler  , ( prop 4). And  is the motion of the intersection point  (that is, the velocity of the point  ) moveing in the line  from  (prop 6). Now since a two fold velocity of the point  is known nemely  toward  &  towards  , make  ; & the motion of the point  shall bee in the line  the diameter of the circle passing through the points  (prop 1) & therefore tangent to the Concha.
To find the point  which distinguisheth twixt the concave & convex portion of the Concha.
[18] Those things in the former proposition being supposed, make triangle  like  or  : &  ∼ , & draw  . Now had the line  onely parallel motion directed by  or  , (since ) the motion of all its points would bee  , (prop 3): & if it had onely circular motion about  , the motion of the point  fixed in that line  would bee  (prop 4): But the motion of the point  is compounded of those two simple motions, & is therefore  (prop 5 & 2); & the motion of the intersection point  made by the lines   , & moveing in  , shall bee  , (prop 6). Now if the line  touch the concha in the required point, tis easily conceived that the motion of the intersection point  is infinitely little; & therefore that the points  &  are coincident,  &  being one streight line, & the triangles  ,  being alike.
Which may bee thus calculated. Make . . . then is  . . . &  . Therefore  . Or .
In stead of the ordinary method de Maximis et minimis, it will be as convenient (& perhaps more naturall) to use ∼ This; Namely To find the motion of that line or quantity ∼ ∼ ∼ & suppose it equall to nothing, or infinitely small. But then the motion to which tis compared must bee finite. That is, the unknowne quantitys ought not to bee at their greates or least, both at once.
[19] Example, In the triangle  , the side  being given & fixed. the side  being given & circulateing about the center  , I would know when  is the shortest it may bee. I call . . . . then is  . & . &  . or . & .  (prop 7). And makeing , tis . Or . (For  signifieing the motion of  towards  may bee finite though,  , its motion towards  doth perish). Wherefore . or . . . . are the greatest & the least valors of the line  .
Should I have taken , instead of . The effect would not have followed because both the motions  &  would have vanished at once in the point {}. But I might have taken the tangent  for  , or any other line which wou{ld} {illeg} coincidere with  at its being greatest or least.
[20] Example 2d. If {} is the Conchoid (. . . .) fo{illeg}  parallell to it. Then is  . &  . & . et  ponatur  esse motus puncti  &  esse motus puncti  versus  . Erit (prop {6}{)}  {illeg}{illeg} . supposeing  (For when  is the least that {illeg}{illeg} bee the point  is that which distinguisheth twixt the concave & convex porti{on} of the Conchoid, & then the motion  vanisheth.) it will bee  .  . &   . Or .

Concerning Equations when the ratio of their rootes is considered.
[21] If two of the rootes of an Equation are in proportion the one to the other as  to  Then multiplying the termes of the Equation by this progression  :&c . &c. ( or by the same progression augmented or diminished by any quantity, as if it bee augmented by  it will bee . &c. Or were it augmented by  it would be ). Then shall the roote which is correspondent to  be a roote of the resulting equation: but inverting the order of the progression, that roote which is correspondent to  shall bee a roote of the equation resulting from such multiplication.
As for example did I know that two of the rootes of the Equation  were in proportion as 1 to 2 & would I have the lesser roote (viz that which is correspondent to 1) I make . . And soe the progression will bee . &c Or . &c by adding  . Or by adding one more it will bee . &c. By any of which progressions the Equation may bee multiplyed, as by the 1st, . Which produceth . Or by the 3d . Which produceth . Or by the first Otherwise by destroying the 1st terme. . Which produceth . &c the rootes of which products are, viz: of the first , & . Of the last , & . There I conclude  to be the lesse, & consequently  the greater of those rootes of the Equation . which are in double proportion But was the greater of those rootes desired then inverting the progression it would bee . Or . The first producing  whose rootes are , . The 2d produceth  whose rootes are  ,  . And consequently  is the greater &  the lesse of the rootes in duplicate propor{tion.}
[22] If in the circle   is the diameter,  a perpendicular to the end of it from which I would draw , which should intersect circle in the points  &  soe that  bee triple to , that is  quadruple to  . Then calling . . . The equation expressing the relation twixt  &  is . the rootes of which equation must be quadruple the one to the other: Therefore would I find  the lesse roote I make . . And the progression will bee, . &c. by which the Equation being multiplyed the product is . Or . Therefore drawing , Or  . from the point  , or  raise the perpendicular  , or . & soe draw .
Would I have  to be a square that is . Then to find  I call it  & . Soe that the lesse roote is to the greater as  to . Making therefore , , The progression will be . By which the Equation , must be multiplyed. & it produceth . Or  Or . & consequently . that is . And  . Or . And consequently . Or it might have beene done thus.  substracted from the precedent progression it will be,  . &c by which the Equation being multiplyed produceth . Or . And by extracting the roote,  . And therefore {} Or . Or  . That is  . And  . And therefore {  }.

Reductions of Equations may bee perhaps performed by this method
[23] As in that problem recited by Des Cartes pag 83, viz: The square  & the right line  being given , to produce  to  , soe that  drawn towards the point  may bee equall to the given line  . Putting  for the unknowne quantity. , & . The Equation will bee . which having 4 rootes the Equation must have 4 divers resolutions; that is the lines  ,  , produced both ways indefinitely, there may bee 4 divers lines drawne through the point  , whose parts intercepted twixt the crosse lines  ,  , are equall to the given line  : And they are   ,  . And therefore the rootes of this equation are (two affirmative)  ,  , (& two negative)  ,  . Because , , Therefore , , , . Soe that . That is one roote  of this equation is to another  as  to  . Therefore I may multiply this Equation by this progression . And there resulteth . That is . Or, . Which result is the same with the first Equation the reason of which is, that if I make  then is . Or if , then is . Or if , then is . Or if  then is . Soe that the relation twixt all the rootes being reciprocally the same & not distinguishing one roote from another, tis noe wonder if they bee all indifferently expressed in the resulting Equation. Otherwise the reduction must have succeeded.
Suppose 3 rootes of an Equation are in proportion to each other as  ,  ,  . Then if that roote which is correspondent to  be required, multiply the termes of the Equation by any of these Progressions  1 . 2 . 3 .                      &c.
As if 3 of the rootes of this Equation  were to one another as . And  would find the roote which is correspondent to  . Then I make , , , & soe I may have by the first progression this . By the 2d; . &c. By the first of which the Equation being multiplyed produceth . That is . Or . & . Or were it multiplyed by the 2d progression thus . It would produce . Or . Soe that  being the least roote, the other two rootes must be  & .
If it be desired to know the length of  &  in this equation  when the rootes are in proportion as  I multiply it by the precedent progression & the results are . Or  . And . Or . . Or . And consequently  .
Likewise were the proportion of 4 or 5 or more rootes given I might set down progressions to find them but it will bee better to set downe the method of finding {those}{these} progressions, And it is this. Suppose two of the rootes of an Equation {illeg} That Equation will bee of this forme  , or of some forme {illeg} of it; And if  corresponds to the desired roote of the Equation this equation  {illeg} will bee of this forme  . Then assuming two termes ({illeg} {  }) {illeg} third {illeg} progression {illeg} {  } by which {illeg} {illeg} multiplyed produceth  Or {  }. And {illeg} {illeg} termes of the {illeg} {illeg}
<56r>
Soe that I have thus much of the progression  . And by the same proceding might continue it or get termes on the other side of the cipher. As if I multiply the Equation by this progression  there is produced . Or . And . Againe multiplying the Equation by  . It is . Or , And . Soe that I have thus much of the progression viz: .
The proceeding is same when the proportion of 3 rootes to one another are given, but there may bee some difference when the ciphers are far distant, as there bee three termes betwixt them, then the operation may be done thus. Let the quantitys, which beare such proportion to one another as the rootes doe bee, , ,  . let  correspond to the roote which must be knowne And then that Equation will bee of this forme, . or else compounded of it. Then assuming some quantity (as  ) for one of the termes of the progression & placing it conveniently, (as it {no{illeg}} equidistant from the ciphers) feigne two other quantitys as  ,  , for the deficient termes and the progression will bee . By which I multiply the Equation . Or . Soe that I have the progression,  by which I againe multiply the Equation & there results . Or . which valor of  substituted into its place in the valor  There will bee thus much of the progression .


The same done otherwise.
Did I know that 2 of the rootes of this Equation , were in proportion as , . Then I suppose one roote to be  , the other  That is . . By one of which I divide the Equation as first by  And the operation is; . Againe I divide the Quotient by the other roote . Thus  . By the last division I have this equation . Or . And . Therefore the rootes of the Equation  are, . .
If I would have  &  of such a length that the rootes of this equation  . be in proportion as , , . I suppose , . . And soe first divide the Equation by . Againe I divide this product  by . Lastly were it necessary I should have again divided this quote  by the 3d supposed roote of the Equation (viz {illeg}). By the 2d {operation} . Or . And by the first  . Or { } Soe that If I make {illeg} the rootes of this Equation  should bee {illeg}

Resolution.
Sett all the termes on one side of the Equation that they become equall to nothing. And first Multiply each terme by soe many times  as  hath dimensions in that terme. Seacondly multiply each terme by soe many times  as  hath dimensions in --> it. Thirdly multiply each terme by soe many times  as  hath dimensions in it &c. The summe of all these products shall be equall to nothing. Which Equation gives the relation of , ,  &c.
[26] Or more generally thus. Order the Equation according to the dimensions of  , & (putting  &  for any two numbers whither rationall or not) multiply the termes of it by any parte of this progression viz :  : Also order the Equation according to  & multiply the termes of it by this progression: . Also order it according to the dimensions of  & multiply its termes by this progression viz . The summe of all these products shall bee equall to nothing. Which Equation gives the relation of , , &c.
Example 1st. If the propounded Equation bee . By the precedent rule the first operation will produce  . The seacond produceth . Which two added together make . (Now suppose a yarde to bee an unit & that A hath moved 3 yardes, then (by the 1st equation)  hath moved two; i.e. , . And at that time by the last Equation  . Or  velocity of   velocity of  .

Example the 2d. If the Equation bee . The first operation will produce . Or . The second produceth . The third . The summe of which is   .

(as in the first example) whereby one quantity & one velocity being supposed the other quantity & velocity may be found & then by this 2d Example the 3d quantity & the 3d velocity may bee found)

[27] Lemma. If two bodys  move uniformely the  from  to  in the same line then are the lines  &  &  &c as their velocitys  .And though they move not uniformly yet are the infinitely little lines which each moment they describe as their velocitys are which they have while they describe them. As if the body  with the velocity  describe the infinitely little line  in one moment. In the moment the body  with the velocity  will describe the line  . For . Soe that if the described {lines} be  &  in one moment, they will bee  &  , in the next. [or better . &c]

Addition connects affirmative numbers into an affirmation sume, & negative ones into a negative  one. as  
Substraction takes the lesse number from the greater, the difference having the same signe prefixed which the greater number {hats} as . .

Of the construction of Problems.
[35] If the equation to be resolved bee . Or yy−ay+bb=0 in which the roote of the last terme (viz b) is knowne, they may bee conveniently resolved by D. Cartes his rules. Otherwise the rootes of that terme must bee first extracted as in this yy−py+q=0. Where I take . & soe describing the circle smf erect lm⊥ln & from m the point of intersection draw mrln. the rootes of the Equation shall bee mq & mr. ln being the radius & n the center of the circle
Or it may bee done thus. Let the Equation bee . Then in the indefinite line af take . erect the perpendicular db=c. And from the point & towards b draw  with which radius describe the circle edf & ae, af shall bee the rootes of the Equation. When note that any quantity may be taken for c, Soe that the operacion may thereby be made convenient, & to that purpose the difference twixt db & dc must bee as little as may bee(that is twixt  & 4cc) soe that the circle intersect not (ef) over obliquely nor the circle be over greate.
[36] As if I had this Equation yy+6y−9=0 Or yy=−6y+9. Then must I make . Then if I make c=6 it will bee . Therefore I take . . . And soe describing the circle efc, I have one affirmative roote af, another negative ae.

Note that if dc is negative or not greater then  the circle cannot intersect the line eaf & therefore the rootes of the equation are immmagina{rie}.

Or it might beee done by the intersection of a circle & one of these lines, viz y3+byy−hx=0 when the equation is reduced to such a forme that pp=4q. Or this y3+byy+gy−hx=0. Or this y3+gy−hx={0}, s being affirmative & p=0. Or this y3+d−fyx=0 when p=0, & q & v affirmative. &c.
[39] But all Equations in Generall may bee resolved by the line a2x=y3, after this manner. First (making a=1) describe the line x=y3 uppon a plate. (as cadce. Then in which ab=x. bc=y). Then suppose the Equation to bee resolved bee y9*+my7+ny6+py5+qy4+ry3+syy+tq+v=0. (in which the letters m, n, p &c: signifie the [40] knowne quantitys of each terme affected with its signe + or −). I describe another line cdce, whose nature (making ab=x, bc=y) is the exprest  & letting fall perpendicula{r} from every point where these two lines intersect as, df eg, they shall bee the rootes of the propounded eqation.
In like manner was the Equation to bee resolved y10*+my8+my7+py6+qy5+ry4+sy3+ty2+ry+w=0 the nature of the line cdce would bee . Or else it might bee . Or had I this Equation y10+{l}y9+my8+ny7+py6+qy5+ry4+sy3+ty2+vy+w=0. The nature of the line cdce would bee, . Or, . Or it might bee, . If the resolved Equation have fewer dimensions that is if some of the ultimate termes as, w, v, t &c: (or intermediate termes as m, n &c be blotted out: Or if the Equation have more than 10 dimensions{th}e nature of the lines cdce to bee described may be known by the same manner observing the order of the progression
Tis evident alsoe that there are 3 divers lines by which any Probl: may bee resolved unless some of them {chanch} to be the same, the easiest whereof is to bee chosen. It appeares also how Equations of 2 & 3 dimensions may be resolved by drawing streight lines; of 4, 5, & 6 by describing some conick section; of 7, 8, 9, by describing a line of 3 dimensions; of 10, 11, 12, by a line of 4 dimensions, &c: but yet y is never above 2 dimensions & consequently all these lines may bee described by the rule & compasses.
Had I this line y4=x. described on a plate & this Equation to bee resolved viz: y13+ly12*+ny10+py9+qy8+ry7+sy6+ty5+vy4+wy3+ayy+by+c=0. It might bee resolved by describing the line whose nature is . A line of the 2d sort. Whereas by the preceding rule was required that a line of the 3d sort should have [41] beene described. And here observe that taking the square number which is next greater than the number of the dimensions of the resolvend equation. That Equation may bee resolved by lines, the number of whose dimensions is not greater than the roote of the square number. And the rectangle of those numbers which signifie how many dimensions th{e} lines have, may always bee greater or equall but never lesse than the number of dimensions of the resolvend Equations. For the number of points in which two lines may intersect can never bee [42] greater than the rectangle of the numbers of theire dimensions. And they always intersect in soe many points, excepting those which are immaginarie onely. Soe that all Equations  guished into sorts.) {St} will often bee very intricate to resolve Equations of many dimensions by the simplest line by which they may be resolved & also for the most part will regaine a description of two lines for every probleme. And then {if maybe often} {illeg} end to use two lines whereas {illeg} compound the other more simple & {illeg} As perhaps an Equation of 16 dimension may bee more speedily resolved by two lines {illeg} of 6 dimensions then by two lines {illeg} 4 dimensions.

[43] But it will not bee {amisse} to shew more particularly how these resolutions may bee performed. And that firs by the parabola
Suppose therefore I had the parabola x=yy exactly described & would resolve {illeg} plaine probleme the Equation yy+ky+l=0. I take ag=l. gf=k. fh=1=lateri recto Parab: & so draw the line gh & from the intersection points d, e, draw db, ec perpendicular to the axis gc. which shall bee the rootes of the Equation which are affirmative when they fall on the contrary side to fh, but negative if on the same, as in this case.
[44] But were I to resolve a sollid problem the Equation being of 4 dimensions, I take away the 2d terme, makeing it of this forme y4*+lyy+my+n=0. Then take  . . Then perpendicular to ap draw af=aq. Also draw fkap, & from the point of intersection k draw kh=n. lastly draw kr⊥ap, & with the radius wr upon the center q describe the circle tsm. (or, which is the same, take . & soe erecting the perpendicular rw, with the Radius rw describe the circle tsm) & from the points where it intersects the Parabola let fall perpendiculars to the axis, (tv, nm) they shall bee the rootes of the Equation the affirmative ones falling on the contrary side to pq. when m is affirmative.
[45] If I would resolve the cubick Equation y3+ky2+ly+m=0 (which multiplyed by y−k=0 produceth ) I make . . . fkae⊥af=aq. kd=km. And with the radius cg upon the center q describe the circle wf. Or else doe thus (since k is one of the rootes of the Equation ) make k=ab+ar & draw bwae (or make ar=kk, & wr⊥ap) & describe a circle with the radius wq. Then letting fall perpendiculars from the intersection points, they (being the rootes of the Equation ) shall all, except wr=k, bee the rootes of the Equation y3+kyy+ly+m.
This operation will bee much shortened when the 2d terme is wanting for {that} since k=0. it will bee . .  & aq the radius of the circle.
[46] And if the last terme {vanish} that is if I would resolve this equation yy+ky+l=0. by the intersection of a circle & parabola. I must take . . .  & soe with the radius aq upon the center q describe a circle, & the perpendiculars from the intersection points to the axis (a, tv) are the rootes excepting one which is equall to k.
<69r>
[47] If I had the crooked line described fig 1st[48] whose nature is x=y3, & would resolve the Equation y3*+lyy+m=0. (calling ad=x, dg=y; Or a=-x. ce=-y) I take ab=m. bd=l. df=1. & df⊥bd & draw bf infinitely both ways. From the intersection points (as e) letting fall perpendiculars, they shall bee the rootes of the Equation y3*+lyy+m. as ce which in this case is negative because on that side on which y is negative.
Would I resolve this equation yy+ky+l=0. (which multiplyed by y-k produceth ) I take ab=kl, (fig 2d)[49] bδ=l, δd=kk. df=1, & soe through the points b & f draw the streight line bfλ (Or which is the same take ab=kl. k=ah⊥ab. & draw hλab untill it intersect the crooked line in λ (i. e. untill hλ=k3 & soe through the points λ & b draw λbfe). Then from the intersection points to the axis letting fall perpendiculars they (being the rootes of the Equation .) shall all, except βλ=k, be the rootes of the Equation yy+ky+l=0.
[50] Would I resolve the Equation z4+az3+bzz+cz+d=0. It may bee done by a circle thus. Multiply it by this Equation zz−az+aa−b=0, & it will produce , Of this forme z6**+mz3+nzz+pz+q=0. In which (n) ought to be affirmative, & if it bee not, then augment or diminish the rootes of the Equation z4+az3+bzz+cz+d=0. & then repeate the operacion again untill there bee an Equation of this forme z6**+mz3+nzz+pz+q=0 in which n is affirmmative. Then (dividing this equation by  it is  therefore) take . . & with the radius , describe the circle dk & the perpendiculars (as dh ck) multiplyed by  shall bee the rootes of the Equation.

Some Problems of Gravity & levity &c
[52] Prob 1. To find the proportion of the weights of two equall bodys the one being sollid the other liquid.        Resp.      If the Sollid body A bee heavier than the liquid B weigh it in the aire & in the liquid Body B; & the difference of those two weights is the weight of soe much water as is equall to that sollid body & so much {wyer} as {deppend} in the {water}. But if it bee lighter than the liquid body B, hang a heavier body C to it, that will sinke it; & weigh them first the body A being in the air & C in the liquid body, 2dly both A & C being in the liquid body; & the difference of these weights is the weight of so much water as is equall to A (& also to soe much thred wyer or hayre as was weighed both in the water & air.)
[53] Note that the weight of soe much water as is equall to that parte of the wyer (to which A & C are fastened) which was weighed both in the air & water, bee subducted from the whole weight of the water & the remaining weight shall bee the weight of the water required.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Or Thus, Make the scoale B as light as may bee, yet soe that it will sinke it selfe in the liquid body CC, & sinke the body A also, if A chance to bee lighter than CC. Suppose that f the weight of scoale B in the water, & g in the aire; & that e is the weight of B+A in the water, & d in the aire: then is d−g+f−e the weight of soe much water as is equall to A. Note that the water must reach {'}at both weighings to the same point {illeg} of the wyer & that the wyer bee as small as may bee.
Cor: Hence the proportion of weights of all bodys sollid or liquid or both may bee gathered. & wee may hence deduce tables of the weights of equall bodys, & of the quantitys of bodys equally heavy.
[54] Prob 2. Two bodys {illeg} D & E given to find the proportion of their quantity.        Weigh them in the scale B, let their weight & the weight of the scale in the air bee h & k, in the water, m & n then is D{illeg} E∷h−g+f−m:k−g+f−n.

To find the weight of the body d.          Resp. Suppose that the bodys a & d, b & e, c & f−d−e are of the same matter; & that the weight of the bodys a, b, c, f, d, e, f−d−e, in the aire are g, h, k, p, x, rx, p−x−rx{;} & in the water l,   m, n, v, s, t, v−s−t.    Then is g:l∷x:s. & h:m∷rx:t. & k:n∷p−x−rx:v−s−t. Therefore . And ghkv−ghnp=hklx+gkmrx−ghnx−ghnrx. Or .
If the weights g=h=k, (as may bee either by experience or calculacion (see coroll: Prob 1) Then is .    Now because gold is usually allayed by mixing with it brasse & silver of each an equall weight; suppose that a & d are brasse, b & e silver, c & f−d−e gold, & that x=rx, or r=1.

Of Equations,
Every equation hath soe many roots as dimensions of which some may be true some false & some imaginary or impossible.
If there bee some imaginary then the true & false rootes may be knowne by the signes of the Equations termes: Namely there are soe many true rootes as variations of signes & soe many false ones as successions of the same signes. When any termes are wanting supply their{e} voyd places with ±0.
But if any because imaginary roots are properly neither true nor false roots bee imaginary, this r{oote} soe far admitts of exception. Thus the signes of this Eq: x3−pxx+3ppx−p3=0. show it to have three true roots, wherefore if it bee multiplyed by x+2a=0 the resulting equation x4+px3+ppxx+6p3−q3x−2pq3=0 should have thre true rootes & a false one, but the signes shew it to have three false & one true. I conclude therefore that the two roots which in the one case appeare true, & in other false are neither, but imaginary; & that of the other two roots one is true {the} other false.
Hence it appeares that to know the particular constitution of any Equation it is {chi{illeg}fely} necessary to understand what imaginary roots it hath. And this in some of the simplest Equations is easily discovered, thus in xx±ax+bb=0, both roots are imaginary if 4bb<aa, otherwis both reall. And thus in px3−apx−q=0 two roots are imaginary if 4p3<27qq, otherwise all reall. But to give accurate rules for determining the number of these roots in all sorts of Equations would bee a thing not onely very difficult, but uselesse, because in Equations of many dimensions the rules would bee more intricate & laborious to put in practise then to solve the Equations either by lines or numbers. Soe that the accurate determination{s} of those roots is for the most part {esilyest} acquired by solving the Equations.
But yet because the discovery of these roots is very usefull I shall lay downe rules whereby they may bee many times discovered at first sight, & almost always without much labour.
First then the number of impossible roots is always eaven. If one bee impossible there must bee two, if three there must bee foure &c. And hence Equations of odd dim{en}sions must have one roote reall at least.
Secondly the number of reall roots of any Equation are not more then the number of its termes.  Thus x4−2x+3=0 {illeg} have all foure roots reall & therefore must have two imaginary.  Thus x5−3x4+4=0 can have but thre reall roots & two must bee imaginary. Hence are to bee excepted equations which {want} all their odd termes as x6−2x4+3xx−2=0. And in {illeg} like cases write y for xx. And so many terme roots as duct y3−2yy+3y−2=0 hath {times} soe many reall roots, halfe true halfe false, & four times soe imaginary ones the other x6−2x4+3xx−2=0 shall have.
Thirdly, if under the termes of any Equation you set a progression of {fractions} each having the dimension of the terme above it for its {illeg} & number {denominating} that terme first second third &c for its denominator & {illeg} if {illeg} {illeg} any {illeg} together so that the rectangle of the first {illeg} multiplyed {viz the fraction} {illeg} first {illeg} square of the {illeg} terme multipl{illeg} by {the fraction} {illeg} conclude there are two imaginary roots {illeg} if {illeg} one {illeg} <85v> in all throughout the equation conclude also there are two imaginary roots at least. If equall in all cases throughout the Equation, conclude that all the roots of the equation are equall. If it be greater or equal to it in two places of the equation & not in all places betwixt conclude there are foure imaginary roots at least. If it bee greater or equall to it in three places of the equation & not in all places betwixt, conclude there are six imaginary roots at least. And soe of the rest.
Thus if the Equat be x3−3xx+4x−2=0. Th en the progress is . & because , I conclude there are two roots imaginary at least.
 there are two imaginary roots.
 all the 3 roots are equall.
 conclude two rootes are imaginary.
 imaginary roots at least, also by the three last termes  (1) therefore all 4 roots are imaginary unlesse the like happen in the three middle termes. I try therefore & find  & soe can conclude but two rootes imaginary.
  Therefore I conclude all four roots imaginary.
 are two imaginary roots{.} Also the 3d 4th & 5t terme give  therefore since by the 2d 3d & 4th terme tis  I conclude ther are 4 roots imaginary. Also by the 4th 5t & 6t termes I find  but thence nothing can be concluded because those three termes are of the same condition with the 3d 4th & 5t termes which immediately precede them. Lastly I find by the three last termes ; And by the termes pr{e}ceding them . Therefore I conclude there are two more imaginary roots; that is in all 6 & but one reall.
Thus in litterall Equations, if , because 1×3ppx{illeg}  therefore what ever numbers are taken for p and q two roots shall bee imaginary. And soe of the rest.
This rule may be otherwise thus exprest. Over the termes of the equation set a series of fractions each having the dimensions of the terme under it for its numerator, & the number denominating the terme first, second {third} &c for its denominator. Then in every three termes observe{illeg} whither the square of the middle terme multiplyed by the fraction above be greater equall or lesse than the factus of the {terme} before & after it multiplyed by the fraction over the terme before it. If greater write the signe + underneath; if equal or lesse write the signe − underneath the middle terme & lastly set + under the first terme of the equation. Then observe how many changes there are from + to − & conclude that there are soe many pa{ires} of imaginary roots{.} unlesse all the roots bee equall
Thus  hath 2: &  hath 4 {illeg} many {roots}
<86r>

If you would bee more exact set downe after their signes the differences of the said squares & rectangles . And then if you see three differences together with the same signe soe that the square of the meane diff bee less then the rectangle of the other two change the signe of the said meane difference

If you would bee yet more exact, augment the roots of the Equatio the more the better, & at least soe much as to make them all true. then set the afforesaid differences with their signes underneath as before. And under them the progression of fractions squares. Then if you see three differences together with the same signe soe that the square of the middle difference multiplyed by the fraction under it bee not greater than the rectangle of the other two differences multiplyed by the fraction under the first: change the signe of the middle difference.
Any Equation being propounded, set down a series of so many fractions as the Equation hath dimensions, whose numerators & denominators are a progression of units backward & forward. Divide each fraction by that preceding it & set the quotes in order overal the middle termes of the Equation. Then observe of every middle terme whither it square multiplyed by the fraction over it bee greater equall or lesse than the rectangle of the two termes on either hand. If greater write + underneath, if equall or lesse write −. Lastly set + under the first & last terme & there shall bee soe many impossible roots as there are changes of signes. Unlesse it happen that all the roots are equall, for &c:
Thus if x5−4x4+x3−2xx−5x−4=0. The series of fractions will bee  And dividing  by  &  by  &c there results  to bee set over the middle termes of the equation th{illeg}s  the third : therefore I write −. In the 4th  (-20) therfore I write +. In the 5t  therefore I write +. lastly under the first & last terme I write +. And soe finding two changes of termes I conclude two roots to bee impossible.
  
<86v>
Sometimes there may bee impossible not by this meanes discovered, which if you suspect, augment or diminish the roots of the Equation a little, not soe much as to make them all affirmative or all negative, or at most not much more. & try the rule againe. And if there bee any impossible roots twill rarely happen that they shall not bee discovered at two or three such tryalls. Nor can there bee an Equation whose impossible roots may not bee thus discovered.
Thus if x3−3ppx−3p3=0, in which noe impossible appeare I put x=y−p & the result is y3−3pyy−p3=0 in which two appeare, Or if I put x=y−2p the result is y3−6pyy+9ppy−5p3=0 in which also two appeare.
Thus if , I set the signes + & − under it as before and find two imaginary roots & to try if it have any more I suppose x=y+1 & the result is x5+6x4+10x3+9xx+5x+0


Now by this rule false roots may bee often discovered at first sight; as if you see a terme wanting twixt two others of the same signes, or if it bee greater there either of those two or its square then their rectangle; conclude there is a paire of impossible roots at least & set the signe − under that terme also set the signe + on either side the term {wanting}. As in this . In which it appears there are 4 if not 6 impossible roots
If there bee two or more termes wanting set signes under them successively to begining with a negative{illeg} only end with an affirmative if the terms on either hand have contrary signes. As in  so in  The first shows 4, the last two roots imaginary: Soe{.} in  which hath {8} roots imaginary

To reduce severall equations by divisors of {three} dimensions.
Get the divisors of 6 or 7 or 8 such numbers as were described before. Add & sustract them from 29. 8. 1. 0. -1. -8. -27. Take any three numbers out of the {three} middle ranks, r, s. t. Make -s=c.  . Then see if you can find 4a+2b+c in the rank preceding these & 9a+3b+c in the rank preceding that also 4a−2b+c in the rank following these & 9a−3b+c in the rank after that{;} if you can try the division by x3−axx+bx−c.
Or better multiply all the numbers in the middle rank by 5 & 10. Let s, {o} {v} signify the products, out of the two ranks on either side take any two eaven or two odd numbers Let those be r & t. Then making .  observe if you can find 4m+2n+any s in the rank preceding those or 4m−2n+any s in the rank following those & then 9m+3n+any v in the 2d rank preceding those & 9m−3n+any v in the 2d rank following them. If so try the division by .
Or yet better. Do not add & subduct the divisors from 9, 4, 1, 0, 1, 4, 9 but try if of those in the first & last rank the difference of any two eaven or two odd ones be divisible by 6. Call  that difference G &  the summ of the same terms H. Then try in the middle collumn there be any term which subducted from H, or added to it produces a number divisible by 9. Call that term + c if it be subducted or − c if added. [Then try if in that column next before or after the middlemost which has fewest divisors there be any te{rm} {illeg} which added to or subducted from  produces a number divisible by 9] & the summ or difference K, & putting , & G −=b. Try if you can find 8−4a+2b−c on the 2d rank above the middle one or 8+4a+2b+c in the 2d rank ra{illeg} below it. If so try the division by x3−ax2+bx−c. Or thus against those divisors added & subducted from 27. 8. 1. 0. 1. 8. 27. set 9a+ {illeg}b+c. 4a+2b+c. a+b+c. c. a−b+c. 4a−2b+c. 9a−3b+c. then choose the three ranks of the fewest terms & in them those numbers one in each by which get the valor of a, b, & c. & those gotten will give you numbers to be sought in the other ranks, which if you find there try the division by x3−axx−bx−c. otherwise lose there other numbers out of the same 3 ranks, & doe so till you have gone through all variety.
Note that if the last term of the æquation be p the last but one q, Then if c &  have a common divisor which divides {n}ot q, that c is to be rejected. Also if  or  be greater then the greatest term of the æquation that b or a is to be rejected.
Or thus best. Let the numbers which arose by substituting 2. 1. 0. -1. -2 for x be G. H. I. K. L. If I end not in 5 or {0} substitute 10 & -10 for x & let the numbers arising be F. & M{illeg} but if I end in 5 or 0 & H or K do not, increase or decrease the root of the æquation by an unit. Do so also if {H} be an eaven number and H or K an odd one with fewer divisors & then substitute 10 {&} -10 for x{.}

How numeral æquations are to be  reduced by divisors of 3 or 4 or more dimensions
Substitute 5, {6}, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -{illeg}, -5 & also 4 & -4 if need be, for x, & suppose the resulting terms, be F, G, H, I, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q. Find all their divisors set those of F & Q together by pairs whose last figures are equal or differ by 5. Gather the summs & differences of these pairs. Let summ of any two be R, the tenth parts of their difference S if their last figures, ✝ < insertion from the left margin > ✝ And if the æquation be not of more than 5 dimensions so that it must be divisible (if at all) by a divisor of 2 dimensions set down xx∓Sx  to be tried for such a divisor. Where R & S must have the same signes if the divisor of F was greater then the divisor of K otherwise contrary signes. < text from f 88v resumes > Quadruple the divisors of L. & if the two last figures of any one be the same with the two last figures of 2R, take it from 2R. Let the residue divided by 100, be T. Or if the two last figures of any one added to the two last figures of 2R make 100 add it to 2R & let the summ divided by 100 be T & let the number whose quadruple is added to or subducted from 2R be a And if the æquation be of 6 or 7 dimensions & no more set down x3+Txx+{S-25}+a to be tried Where note that S & T must be negative if they were found so above & a must be negative if it was added to 2R to make T, or els ffirmative if it was subducted. & the same is to be observed of the signes in the following operations.
But if the æquation be of more then 7 dimensions then look among the divisors of K for a number which added to or subducted from S+T+a gives a number divisible by 24. This number divided by 24, call v & the divisor which gave it call β And set down  to be tried for a divisor if the æquation be not of more then 9 dimensions. Where {v} must be negative if if it was so above.
But if the æquation be of more then 9 dimension then Cook among the divisors of M for a number which added to or subducted from −S+T+a gives a number divisible by 24. This number divided by 24 call W & the divisor which gave it {γ}. And set down  to be tried for a divisor if the æquation be not of more then 11 dimensions or supposed divisible by {−} Divisor of not more {than} 5 dimensions Atq3 ita in infinitum pergitur
Now the trial of these divisors is this suppose the divisor be a+bx+cxx+dx3+ex4+fx5 &c And observe if {illeg} be among the divisors of L{,} if this Divisor ascend but to {two} dimensions{;} & a+b+c+1 among the divisors of K if {illeg}ascend but to two or 3 dimensions & a−b+c{−d−1} {illeg} divisors of {illeg} if it ascend but to 2, 3 or 4 
<89r> dimensions & a+2b+4c+d+e+1 among the divisors of I if it ascend not to more then 5 dimensions & a−2b+4c −d+e−f+1 among the divisors of N if it ascend to no more then six dimensions & a+3b+9c+27d+81e+243f+&c among the divisor of H if it ascend not to more then 7 dimensions, & so in infinitum In all which put c=1 & d, e, f = 0 if the divisor be of 2 dimensions or d=1 & e, f, = 0 if of 3 dimensions, & so on.[58] And when you have tried all the divisors which may be found by this {rale}, {&} rejected those which will not hold this trial: if there remain more or if the æquation be not divisible by any of those which remaine, you may conclude the æquation irreducible by any rational divisor.

De resolutione Quæstionum circa numeros.
Primo numeri quæsili redigendi sunt ad æquationem secundum conditiones quæstionis, Deinde exponendi sunt per basem et ordinatam curvæ lineæ quam æquatio illa designabit.  Sit curva ista DC et numeri AB, BC, curva existente tali ut numerus BC ordinatim applicatus ad numerum AB in dato angulo ABC semper terminetur ad eam. Deinde inquirenda erunt puncta curvæ quæ efficient numeros AB, BC rationales. Casus autem in quibus hoc fieri deprehendo sunt sequentes.
1. Si numeri in æquatione non ultra gradum quadraticum ascendant ita ut curva sit Conica {s}actio: et detur aliquod punctum F in curv{æ} quo efficitur ut numeri AH. HF. sint rationales ex hoc unico exemplo regula generalis sic elicietur. In AH cape HE cujusvis rationalis longitudinis, age EF, secet hæc curvam in G et demissa GH parallela CB numeri AK, KG erunt rationales. Si punctum F reperitur in linea AH, FH existente nullâ, tunc cape HN cujusvis rationalis longitudinis, Erige NE parallelam BC, & cujusvis etiam rationalis longitudinis.  Age HE occurrentem curvæ in G et erunt AK KG rationales.
Quoniam {itaq3} hic unicum s{a}{illeg}tem exemplum requiritur, primo inquarendum est ejusmodi exemplum, dein regula generalis inde elicietur ut supra. Exempl{i} autem inveniend hec erit methodus{.} ni melior occurrat. Sit æquatio axx+bxy+cyy+dx+ey+y=0 ubi x et y designant numeros. Et si terminus f desit, punctum istud erit A. Si x in æquatione axx+dx+f=0 sit rationale puncta duo erunt in AB. Si cyy+ey+f sit rationale puncta duo erunt in recta quæ ducitur ab A parallela BC. Si bb−4ac sit quadratus numerus affirmativus tunc curva erit Hyperbola Et recta ducta a puncto A vel B parallela Asymptoto secans curvam in G exhibebit numeros AK GK rationales. Sunt alij innumeri casus quibus enumerandis non immoror
2 Si æquatio ascendit ad tres dimensiones, et tria habentur exemplo rationalia non in arithmetica progressione possunt inde innumera alia reperiri sint enim P, Q, R puncta Curva ad ista exempla  Junge PR, RQ, PQ et punctum S, T, Y ubi PR, RQ, PQ secant curvam dabunt alios tres numeros. Dein junge QS et punctum x quo QS secat curvam dabit aluim numerum. et Sic in infinitum.

Cauda jam 70 q3adas fere longa duas Cata tendebat versus intervallum inter {schedir} et lucidam cathedræ({illeg} Epist. 2). In Astrolabio vero Flamstedij, Ar{is} caudæ productus secabat ab intervallo inter caput & pectus Cassiopeiæ tertiam ejus partem versus pectus, desinebat autem e regione schedir. Transibat axis ille per caput Delphini, dimidio gradu a stellis duab{us} orientalibus in capite equiculum versus distans. Dein a distantia ultimarum duarum in ala austrina cygni auferebat quinq3 nonas partes distantiæ illius versus stellam ultimam in ala. Postea a spatio inter terminum catenæ Andromadæ & stellam proximam in capite Cephei auferebat tertiam partem distantiæ illius versus terminum caten{æ}
 Decem 24 Cauda transibat per medium intervallum stellarum duarum borealium in manu superiori Andromedæ et vix ultra Schedir extendebat (Flamst. Epist. post.) Desinebat igitur in long.  4 vel 5gr, lat. gr. In Astrolabio Flamstedij cauda desinebat e regione pectoris Andromadæ. Transibat autem (sed on rect{æ}) per medium punctum inter genu dextrum seu australe Pegasi et stellam illam informem ad pedem dextrum quartæ magnitudinis cujus Long  29 55 lat bor 36. 11. Dein per pr{æ}dictas stellas duas in manu superiori Andromedæ. Juxta Astrolabium stellæ duæ {γ}, δ invictu equiculi, et Cometa triangulum rectangulum constituebant Angulus rectus erat ad stellam occidentaliorem γ. Cometa boream versus distabat ab hac stella tertia parte distantiæ stellarum.
 Dec 26 Genu sinistrum Pegasi (quæ stella tertiæ magnitudinis et Bayero dicitur {η} erat inmedio caudæ Flamst. Epist. {ult}.). Sed hac nocte et præc{æ}dent{e} caudæ terminus ob Lunæ splendorem haud satis definiri potuit (Flamst. epist. 2.) Unde die 24 gradus unus forte et alter ad caudæ longitudinem addi debet. Cauda vero hactenus semper curva apparuit, sed non valde curva. Convera sui parte austr{um} respiciebat: qua etiam parte lucidior et distinctiùs terminata apparuit quam altera.
 Decem 28 Cauda 56grad longa distantiam inter Alamac et lucidam in femure Cassiopeiæ bisecans ultra pergebat ad usq3 Persei Caput (Observat Hamburgens.)
 Decem 29 Cauda tangebat Scheat sitam ad sinistam & intervallum stellar{is} in pede boreali Andromadæ accur{a}te complebat (Flamsteed epist ult Decem 30, hora  Situs erat humerus Pegasi seu scheat in latere australi caudæ ita ut per caudam l{a}ceret, a termino caudæ quinta circiter vel sexta parte latitudinus caudæ distans.

Desinebat vero in medio loco inter stellam τ quintæ magnitudinis in capite Persei & extemam in borealis pede Andromadæ, sive inter stellam γ tertiæ magnitudinis in humero boreali Persei & punctum qu{a} distantia duarum in pede boreali Andromadæ bisecantur.

Latitudo caudæ juxta duas λ, μ in pectore Pegasi (hoc est 5gr a capite Cometæ) erat distanti{a} duarum illarum stellarum una cum triente distantiæ (nempe 1gr {30′} circiter). Ejusdem juxta humerum Pegasi (seu  gr a capite) latitudo erat dimidium distantiæ humen illius et Pegasi genu sinistri orientalis, adeoq3 2gr 30′ circitem. Ejusdem inter {illeg}put Andromadæ et annulum qui est in termino catenæ, (hoc est gr a capite) latitudo caudæ erat quinta par{illeg} distantiæ stellarum illarum feré adeo{illeg} {illeg} {illeg} caudæ latitudo adhuc {illeg} {illeg} <100r> aliquantulum usq3 ad extremitatem fere, ita ut tandem evaderet 5gr vel paullo major (Ego).
 Decem 30 hor {8} Scheat sita erat e latere caudæ ad dextram, et australior duarum in boreali pede Andromedæ erat in medio caudæ. (Flamsteed. [79] Idem et ego observabam hora 9.) Ultra vero hanc stellam australiorem cauda quasi ad 7gr vel gr extendebat circiter(Ego)
 Jan 3 Hor  Cauda transibat per medium intervalli inter Alamac et australiorem in pede boreali Andromadæ &  partes distantiæ stellarum (id est grad) ibi (hoc est 30gr a capite) lata erat. Tendebat verus lucidam in latere Persei sed magis accuratè versus stellam {ι} quartæ magnitudinis in dorso Persei lucidæ proximam quæ tamen sex vel decem minutis circiter distabat ab axe austrum versus. Desinebat verò cauda e regione {a} medij luce inter stellam illam quarta magnitudinis, et aliam ejusdem magnitudinis in humero dextro seu clypeo Persei quæ Bayero θ dicitur. Desinebat igitur in  22gr. 27′ & lat. bor. 30gr 50′. Si borealiorum duarum μν in angulo Andromadæ distantia dividatur in tres partes æquales & una pars sumatur versus mediam trium in angulo μ, ibi erat medium caudæ (hoc est in  25g. 4′ lat 30gr 52′) et ibi hoc est 18gr a capite) latitudo ejus æquabat distantiam stellarum illarum, vel paullo superabat adeoq3 erat✝[80] 2gr 6′ circiter. Ex his colligitur caudam curvam fuisse & convexo sui latere austrum respexisse concavo boream. Cauda jam haud multò lucidior erat quam partes lucidiores viæ hacteæ, si partes capiti proximas excipias, et quidem per ultimos duodecim vel quindecim gradus non erat illis u lucidior. Caput jam multo magis conspicuum erat quam cauda at Decemb 15 cauda maximè conspicua erat caput vero instar stellæ adeò exiguæ apparuit (a crepusculo; scilicet et luce lunari obscuratum) ut nudis oculis ne quidem videre possem quamvis adstantes digitum ad eam intenderent. Longitudo caudæ 41gr. Distantia termini caudæ a circulo solem et cometas jungente 4gr 30′ ′. Delinatio caudæ ab oppositione is 7gr.
 Jan 4 Hor {9} Cauda juxta caput Cometæ tendebat versus lucidam in eductione cruris sinistri Persei, sed postea vergebat ad lucidam in latere Persei et ubi aer admodum defæcatus erat, et meo et {illeg}{sinetium} judicio extendebat ad usq3 stellam {ι} in dorso Persei. Axis caudæ non transibat per stellam {ι}, sed paucis minutis australior existens, dirigebatur {illeg} accurate versus. Media {illeg}rium in cingulo lucidam in eductione cruris Persei Alge{illeg}b. dictam. vel potius versus punctum 5′ aut 6′ australius. Andromadæ erat in medio caudæ. Latitudo caudæ e regione capitis Andromadæ erat  partes distantiæ medij caudæ a capite Andromadæ: Inter Alamac et lucidiorem in altero pede Andromadæ æquabat  vel potius  partes distantiæ stellarum illarum: Juxta cingulum Andromadæ æquabat distantiam duarum obscuriorem in cingulo. Caudæ limes australis lucidior erat et distinctius terminata, item convexior quam li{mes} borealis. Limes borealis ferè recta erat vel potius nonnihil concava. Caput in centro lucidius, inde ad circumferentiam paulatim languescens, apparebat per tubum duodecim pedum sine stella aliqua vel globo lucido in centro, simill{imum vero stellæ} alicui vel planetæ per nubem lucente ita crassam ut stella distinctè cerni nequeat. Totius lucis in capite diameter erat 12′ vel 14′ circiter. Caput nudis oculis instar stellæ quartæ magnitudinis apparebat. Nox hæc superiori clarior erat & Cometa longius distabat ab horizonte. Unde omnia melius definiebam. (Ego) Hinc distantia termini caudæ a circulo jungente solem et cometam 4gr 45′ Angulus quem cauda juxta caput{.} Cometæ efficiebat cum circulo illo gr, juxta terminum caudæ 10 vel 11gr, quem chorda caudæ efficiebat cum eodem circulo 8gr.

 Jan 6 hor  cauda transibat per medium prima et secundæ in cingulo Andromadæ, sed ob aeris crassiliem ultra lineam jungentem Alamach & lucidiorem in altero pede Andromadæ cerni non pouit, quamvis aer non ita crassus esset quin stellæ quartæ magnitudinis apparerent. Caput cometæ cum tota luce sua vix æquabat stellam quartæ magnitudinis.
 Jan 8 hor 8 Cauda, quæ ex australi latere lucidior distinctior & nonnihil convexa erat, a capite incipiens primùm tendebat versus Mirach (seu primam in cingulo Andromadæ) quæ sita erat in medio ejus nisi quod sex vel octo minutis circiter distabat ab ipso medio versus austrum: Postea flectebatur versus Alamach qua sita in ipso medio ejus. Ultra Alamach ad tres vel quatuor gradus luce languescente extendebatur: nec ultra facilè cernebatur quamvis aer adeo clarus esset ut stellæ sextæ magnitudinis apparerent. Aliquando tamen ubi aer solito clarior erat subobscura caudæ vestigia cernebantur usq3 ad lineam jungentem stellas {ι, χ} in tergo et latere dextro Persei & nonnunquam usq3 ad medium locum inter hanc lineam et stellas duas exiguas σ, ψ in cibasi Persei, & semel quidem paulo ultra ita ut stellarum illarum exiguarum citeriorem σ videretur attingere. Namq3 versus stellas illas duas σψ accuratè tendebat. (Ego) Hinc longitudo caudæ minima erat 24gr circiter, media , maxima 35 & semel 36 vel 37′. Distantia termini caudæ a circulo solem et cometam jungente 5gr. Inclinatio caudæ ad hunc circulum juxta caput cometæ 7gr 30′ juxta extremitatem alteram 10gr40′ Inclinatio chordæ caudæ ad eundem circulum 9gr 10′. Caput cum tota sua luce stellis quartæ magnitudinis cassit eas quintæ paullo superavit. Diameter totius lucis circa caput 12′ Lux caudæ semper argentei erat coloris sed jam per totam caudam obscura valde.
 Jan 9 hora  Caudæ longitudo constans erat 15gr vel 16gr extendebatur enim paullo ultra Alamach seu pedem australem Andromadæ. Aliquando tamen ubi aer erat solito clarior luce tenui superare visa est dimidiam distantiam inter Alamach & præfatas duas stellas σψ in cibasi Persei ad quaru citeriorem σ nocte superiori semel extendebat, ita ut longitudo ejus tunc esset 24gr circiter (Ego) Caud{æ} ad latus boreale tetigit Mirach, desis{illeg} verò ad υτ in femore genuq3 Andromadæ. Flamsteed Epist ult.
 Jan 10 hora 6, 8, 10, cauda desinebat ad Alamach{.} Aliquando tamen ubi aer erat solito clarior, luce suboscura se extendebat ad stellam {χ} in australi lateri Persei, vel potius ad puctum duodecim vel quindecim minutis borealiorem quàm stella illa. Seribit Flamstedius caudam hac nocte desysse sub Alamech, directam vero fuisse versus stellam illam illam {χ} in latere Persei, id est si recta producas; at ob curvaturas cauda ubi eo usq3 visibilis extitit deflectebat a {χ} ad punctum 12′ vel 15′ borealiorem.
 Jan 11 hora 8, 9, 10 cauda satis distincta erat ad usq3 Alamech, et paulo ultra, subobscura ad usq3 stellam præfactam exignam {χ} in latere Persei, ubi terminabatur axe caudæ per stellam transeunte. Distantia termini caudæ a circulo solem et Cometas jungente erat igitur 3gr{.} 50′. Inclinatio chodæ caudæ ad circulum illum gr. At distantia illa et inclinatio pa{u}llo majores extitissent si modo cauda æqu{e} longe in sig{illeg} Persei visibiliter extendisset ac aute {illeg} Caput jam cum tota sua luce stellas quinta magnitudinis æquabat.
 Jan 13 Cauda luce perobscura desinebat e regione stellæ præfatæ {χ} in latere Persei, luce satis sensibili inter Alamach {illeg}t Algol. terminabatur.
{illeg} Jan 23 & 24{cometam rursus} {beneficio sensibili impetus} vidi {sed} Cauda ejus {ob Linea} splendorem {netiquam} apparuit caput ejus inter nubecula {illeg}cunda apparuit reliquo ca{illeg}o haud lucidioris ut sentiri ægre {illeg}rit.

Dirigebatur vero axis ejus ad lucidam in humero orientali Auriga accuratà. Unda deviatio caudæ ab oppositione solis boream versus 10gr.Caput Cometæ cum ommi sua luce stellam septimæ magnitudinis æquare videbatur, aut {non {illeg}} superare.
 Jan 30 Caudæ non nisi vestigia quædam obscurissima restabant quæ tamen tam is oculis quam armatis sentin potuete extrudebantur hæcce caudæ vestigia luce magis sensibili ad lineam jungentem Algol et stellas informes in nube arietis, luce minus sensibili ad usq3 lineam jungentem Algol & Pleiadas {Quinimò} nonnunquam sentire visus sum vestigia quædam lucis rarissim{æ} ad usq3 lineam jungentem Algol et stellam 3 tertia magnitudinis in australi pede Persei. Tendebat vero axis reliquiarum caudæ inter genu lucidum Persei & lucidam in humero orientali Aurigæ, nempe versus punctum triente gradus australius quam lucida illa in humero circiter, adeq3 ab oppositione solis deflexit 10gr 4{illeg} circiter. Caput Cometæ cum omni sua luce stellis septima magnitudinis cessit. Ex hoc tempore caudam nudis oculis observare destiti. Telescopio vero septupedali caudam vida usq3 ad Feb 10{illeg} quo tempore duos circiter gradus longa videbatur, & versus punc{illeg} grada uno et altero australius quam lucida in humero orient{a}li Aurigæ dirigi, magis et magis ab oppositione solis deflectens. Posthæ cometam a Feb. 25 ad Mart. 9 demò vidi sed sine cauda. Nam et caput ipsum jam adeo tenue evaserat ut ope Tubi septupedalis cum apertura duarum unciarum cerni vix posset.
Interim ubi me Cometam nudis oculis observasse affirmo nolim credas Myopem vitro concavo c{æ}nisse quo visio redderet distincta. Tali vitro, sed optimo, semper usus sum.
Cæterum cauda quoad directionem, has observabat leges. Ad singulas observationes per caput cometæ et extremitat caudæ in globo due circulos maximos se secantis in A B C D E &c Divide segmenta AB, BC, CD &c in ratione tempo{illeg} inter observationes utrobiq3 factas intercedentium. Per puncta divisio{nus} duc un superficie globi lineam uniformem quæ segmenta illa AB{,} BC, CD &c in punctis divisionum contengat, et in omni casu circulus per caput co{illeg} & extremitatem caudæ ductus tanget linem illam, uniformem {quam} proximè. Unde cauda, dato tempore, quoad positionem duci potest. {illeg} vero quod segmenta AB, BC, CD, DE &c divisa per sum{illeg} temporum duorum observationes utrobiq3 factas intercedentium (AB{illeg} summam temporis pr{e}imi et sedi, BC per summam temporis secun{dam} tertij &c seu AB per tempus inter observationem primam ac tertiam BC per tempus inter secundam at quartam CD per tempus {illeg} tertiam et quintam &c) debent esse in progressione seu geome{tri}ca seu arithmetica alia aut alia quavis regulan. Et {illeg} hinc collatis inter se observationibus cognosci potest an situs caudæ fuerit rect{è} observatus.
Si inter capellam et polum eclipticæ sumatur punctum tribus gradibus distans a capella, cauda Cometæ, a Decem 15 ad Jan 8 versus punctum illud satis accuratè, dirigebatur pra{illeg}tim circa Dec 18, 25, Jan 4.
Si in globo ducatur circulus maximus qui sel{illeg} ecliplipticam {illeg}  20gr in angulo 54gr transiens per stellam α {illeg} ala septentrionali sagillæ, dem per stellam θ quarttæ magnitudinis {illeg} orientali brachio cassiopeiæ, deniq3 per stellam {illeg} in tergo Persei aut per punctum  gradus circiter australius: Cauda Cometæ {ab imd} ad usq3 Jan {:} 4, imd ad Jan 8 salis accuratè terminabatur. Excipe tantum a Dec 15 ad Dec 26 ubi lux ten{uior} in extremitate caudæ ob Lan{illeg} splendorem videri {suon} potuit.

Via cometæ secat eclipticam in  21 in angulo 30gr circiter. Ubi hæc via præfatum circulus correctum secat, hoc est in  20gr 4′ & latitudine boreali 40′ circiter, ibi erit punctum per quod planum, in quo comet{æ} movit, transire debet. Secuit igitur planum illud eclipticam in  20 vel 20 circiter.
Cauda Decem 10, 11, 12, angustior apparuit, Decem 15 paullo latior, Decem 29 & 30 {illeg}ultòlatior, ut et Jan 3 & 4. Uns{e} remoti{o}r a nobi{s} fuit extremitas caudæ Decem 10, 11, 12 quam Decem 29, 30, & Jan 3, 4, cauda in regiones ulti{illeg} & nobis aversas pergen{se}.

Monsieur Richer sent by the French King to make observations in the Island of Cayenna (north Lat 5gr) having before he went thither set his clock exactly at Paris, found then ({viz} at Cayenna) that it went too slow so as every day to loose two minutes & an half for many days together & after his clock had stood & went again it lost 2 minutes every day as before. Whence Mister Halley concluded that the Pendulum was to be shortned in the proportion of   to   to make the clock go true at Cayenna. In Goree the Observation was less exact. They there found

Ex Hookij Cometa edito ann 1678.
Apr 21 1677 Cometa ab Hookio vesus est inter basem trianguli et stellas informes in nube Aristis, in recta linea jungente{m} Cor Cassiopeiæ & Alamak. Distubat ab Alamak austr{illeg} versus  distantiæ cinguli & pedum Andromadæ. Cauda æquabat  distantia ejus ab Alamak, & dirigebatur accurate verus stellam in nasu Cassiopei{æ} quartæ magnitudinis. Unde caput dirigebatur non versus solem qui erat in  11gr sed versus  14gr. Caput æquabat stellam prim{æ} magnitudinis & lumine magis {fi}sco. Stella in medio capitis (per Telescopium qumidecim pedum conspecta) æque lucida apparebat{illeg} ac  ubi prope horizontem versatur. Rotunda erat, sed non distin{illeg} definita. Diameter ejus erat 25″. Comæ verò loti{us} caput ambientis latitudo seu diameter 4′ 10″. id est decuplo major quam diameter capitis. Angustior erat coma et melius terminata solem versus.
Apr 23 Cometa erat in medio puncto inter Algol et l{illeg}idem informium in nube Aristis, nempe in  14 lat. bor. 17gr. Unde orientem versus movebat{e}r sed in linea nonnihil ad austrum deflectente.

L, m, n, s, t stars in the Bears right hinder leg. H, J, K stars in his head & {illeg} neck. Anno 1682 Sept
On Satturday at {1}h 20′ after midnight I saw the comet in V in a right line with the stars F & s, distant from the star s twice as far as that star was from the star t. The tayle pointed directly towards the star K in the eye or cheek, & was about six degrees long reaching  of the way to that star.
Sunday at 9h 20′ before midnight the comet was in X. Xs & sn were equal & a little greater then Xn. ms, mX & 1Xs were equal. Xs was equal to 3st The tai{l}e ended over against the middle of st & produced cut of  or  of qr towards q.
Munday at 8h 40′ at {n}ight vYo were in a right line Yo=1st. The taile ended over against mn or alittle beyond those stars suppose about a degree beyond. & pointed towards a little star p not noted (I think) in the globe.
Tuesday at 9h. 0′ The comet was in Z. oZ was a little greater then DE almost as great as CD. The comet passed about 8′ or 10′ above the star o which is a little scarce noted in the globes. The tayle was crooked, the convex side southward was sensibly brighter{,} then the concave side. The head in this & the former observations scarce so luminous as a star of the first magnitude but more luminous then one of the 2d. The taile went exactly in the middle between the stars m & L or a very little nearer to m & pointed almost at the Pole star, vizt as much below it as the middle star in the little Beares taile was above it & reached up within a degree or two to over against it or very nearely. The tayle produced would have wiped the star A with its north concave side.

[84] Problemata pro numero solutionum quas admittunt distinguntur in gradus. Qu{æ} uni{c} tantum admittunt solutionem sunt primi gradus, quæ secundi, quæ tres tertij, & sic in reliquis. Ut si data recta AB producenda est ad D ita ut punctum D dao intervallo [85] distet a puncto aliquæ C quod in sublimi datur: Solvetur problema si centro C et intervallo isto dato describatur circulus datam illam rectam secans. Et duplici intersectione in D et dprodibit duplex ejus solutio, . Ad utrum vis enim punctum D vel d produci potest recta AB. Quod ostendit Problema secundi gradus esse.

Ut si datum illud intervallum {B}C majus sit quam distantia BC ita ut circulus rectam illam sectet in Δ et δ, respondebitur quæstioni directe producendo AB ad δ et contrario modo ducendo BΔ retrorsum. Directas quantitates notamus præfigendo signum + retrorsas præfigendo signum −: ut in his, + Bδ & BΔ. Et ubi neutrum signum proæfigitur quantitas directa est.

[88] Geometria per intersectiones linearum solvit omnia Problemata, singulas ejusdem problematis solutiones per totidem intersectiones una vice exhibens Nam solutionum omnium eadem est lex et natura ita ut una Geometricè exhiberi non possit qu{in} reliquæ eadem constructione simul prodeant. Unde fit ut ad constructionem cujusq3 Problematis lineæ duæ adhiberi debent quæ se mutu{ò} in tot punctis secare possunt quot Problema admittit solutiones. Ad constructiones omnium problematum primi gradus sufficiunt lineæ rectæ ad eas secundi requiruntur recta et circulus vel duo circuli ad eas tertij requiritur linea magis complexa quæ rectam aut circulum in tribus punctis ad minimum secare possit et sic in infinitum.
[89] Et hinc pro numero punctorum in quibus linea quævis a linea recta secari potest, oritur distinctio linearum in gradus. Primi gradus vel ordinis est linea quam recta in unico tantum puncto secare potest vel cujus intersectionem cum imperata quavis recta determinare Problema est primi gradus. et hujusmodi s{unt} solæ rectæ lineæ. Secundi linea est cujus intersectionem cum recta quavis determinare Problema est secundi gradus et hujusmodi sunt circulus et lineæ illæ omnes quas Comicas Sectiones appellant. Tertij verò gradus linea est cujus intersectionem cum recta determinare problema est tertij gradus est {lissoida} Veterum et sic in infinitum. Lineæ vero quas recta in punctis infinitis secare potest (qualls sunt Spiralis Quadratrix Trochoides & similes) meritò dicentur ordinis ultimi 
 
[90] Concipe rectam BC parallelo motu ad latus  ferri et interea secare rectas quotcunq3 positione dat{a}s AB in B, mF in F HP in P, IQ in Q, KR in R et punctis in ea mobilibus C, D, E, F alias lineas cc, dd, ee, ff describere. Determinari autem concipiantur longitudines BC, BD, BE, BF hac semper lege ut sint AB ad BC et PC ad BD et QD ad BE et RE ad BF in eadem ratione. Et si linea dD ad quam ratio secunda desinit recta est, tunc linea cC ad quam prima desinit erit secundi generis et aliquando primi nesq3 ulla est linea secundi generis quæ non potest hoc modo exhiberi. Sin linea eE ad quam ratio tertia desinit recta assumitur{;} linea vel ad quam prima desinit erit tertij generis et aliquando secundi vel primi . Quod si linea fF ad quam quarta ratio desinit recta statuatur tunc linea cC ad quam prima de{sinit e}rit aut qua{rt}i {aut} inferioris alicujus generis. Et sic novas in infinitum lin{eas designa}re licet, et numerus rationum gradum altissimum lineæ cC semp{er æqua}bit. Tot enim punctis &
<131r>
non pluribus possibile est Curvam illam cC a recta BC secari quot sunt rationes. Nam si verbi gratia tres sint rationes et linea BC detur positione dabuntur AB BE, BP, BQ et BC invenienda erit ea lege ut sit AB.BC ∷BC+BP.BD∷BD+BQ.BE quod Problema triplicem admittere solutionem ex superioribus constat adeoq3 linea BC triplex est. Tria igitur et non plura possunt esse puncta C in quibus recta BC occurr{i}tt Curvæ cC, proinde Curva illa tertij est generis.
Facilius autem imaginamur has curvas ubi per motus locales linearum inter se cohærentium tanquam per organa quædam describi concipimus. Ut si regulæ PC PD datum angulum CPD continentes volvantur circa datum punctum P quod in anguli  illius vertice est et similitur regulæ QC QD datum angulum Q continentes circa punctum Q ea lege ut regulæ PQ, QD se mutuo semper secent ad rectam aliquam lineam positione datam AD et interea reliquarum regularum PC, QC intersectio C motu suo lineam cC designet: Erit hæc cC linea secundi gradus et aliquando primi. Et hac ratione possunt omnes lineæ secundi gradus designari. Deinde si loco rectæ AD substituatur linea aliqua secundi generis per neutrum punctorum PQ transiens et regularum intersectio D in hac movere cocipiatur, altera intersectio C, designabit lineam quarsi gradus aut etiam tertij. . Qua ratione et omnes tertij gradus lineæs quarum commoda aliqua descriptio organica hactemus reperta fuit designare liceat. Atq3 ita ad lineas superiorum generum pergitur, Quod idem fiet si regularum {.}duæPC, PD non volvantur circa polum P sed parallelo motu ferantur ita ut concursus earum P pergat in recta aliqua positione data. Sed Et ad majorem designandi copiamvice rectarum regularum adhiberi possunt curvæ.
[91] Lineam vero ut cC in qua punctum aliquod indeterminatum ut C perpetuò reperitur veteres dixerunt puncti illius locus et quoniam problematum constructiones pendebant a descriptione duorum locorum puncti quæsiti in quorum intersection{es} situm inveniretur, ideo. Veteres ad hujusmodi locorum compositionem ut loquebantur id est ad eorum inventiorum ac determinationem summis viribus intebuntur. Duo autem hic requiruntur. Primum ut sa{illeg} datis loci conditionibus, sciamus {æqualis} sit et quomodo describendus deinde ut in quolibet problemata loca inveniamus quæ {simplicissima sunt} et facillis{illeg}à determinari ac describi {possint} sed {illeg} quam {hec de} his agamus proprietates {curvarum cognoscendæ sunt.} Insigniores sunt hæ.

Cæterum hæ lineæ utplurimum crura habent in infinitus serpentia quæ aut Hyperbolici sunt generis aut Parabolici. Concipe punctum B secundum lineæ curv{æ} crus AB  delatum abire in infinitum et interea curvam a linea mobili BC semper tangi. Incidat autem semper a puncto atiquo G in tangentem illam perpendiculum GC, et ubi punctum B in infinitus abit si GC fit infinite longum tangente BC prorsus evanescente crus illud AB Parabolicum est, sed si GC non fit infinitè longum, crus Hyperbolicum est et tangens in ultima positione seu recta illa (uti DE) quacum tangens ultimò convenit, cruris illius Asymptotos appelatur. Crus vero infinitum semper habet socium suum qui nunc ad eandem nunc ad opposit{u}m plagam tendit. Et paris Hyperbolici semper eadem est Asymptotos. Estq3 hæc Assymptotorum insignis proprietas, quod si curva cujusvis generis plenè Hyperbolica secetur a recta in pleno numero punctorum G, H, I et recta illa secet etiam omnes  Asymptotos puta AB, AC, BC in D, E, et F pars vel summa partium rectæ Asymptoto vel ab Asymptotis ad crura totidem versus unam plagam extens{a}rum æqualis est parti vel summæ partium similium a reliquis Asymptotis versus alteram plagam ad reliqua crura tendentium DG=EH+FG, vel EG+FH=DI. Curvam verò plenè Hyperbolicam voco qua alia ejus generis cruva non potest habere plura paria crurum Hyperbolicorum. Habet autem tria paria si sit tertij generis quatuor si quarti et sic deinceps. 
[95]Ex crurum infinitorum numero et et diversitate {q3}endet distinctio curvarum in species principales. Sunt autem alia crura conspirantia seu ad eandem plagam tendenti{æ}, alia divergentia seu vergentia in oppositas plagas et utraq3 rursus {vel} ad easdem partes convexa vel ad contrarias. Par crurum Parabolicorum {illeg} Hyperbolicorum conspirantium æquipollet duobus paribus Hyperbolicorum divergentium, et Par Parabolicorum divergentium æquipollet tribus: saltem in curvis tertij generis. Unde sci{ri} potest quot crura cujusvis generis curva quævis habere potest Ut si curva terti generis habebt par sive Parabolicum sive Hyperbolicum conspirans: non habebit misi aliud par Hyperbolic{u}m divergens. Sed et Ellipses conjugatæ considerandæ sunt quæ et aliquando in puncta conjugata contra{punctur} , aliquando prorsus evanescente: Asymptotorum item situs an parallelæ sunt vel {inclinatus et aliæ} quædam differentia {illeg} notæ {illeg} est.

<134r> ita commemorare ut eadem lineis etiam superiorum generum competere insinuarem. 
[96] Cæterum quoniam cognitio determinatio ac curvarum maximè pendet a cruribus infinitis, hæc autem cum eorum Asymptotis noscuntur ex tangentibus; tum etiam qui{a} tangentium inventio post{hec} alijs inservient usibus: methodum jam subjungam ducendi rectas quæ curvas quasvis nondum descriptas postquam describuntur tangent.

Et si linea illa sit prima continuè proportionalium et alia quævis AB secunda, tertiam sic designamus AB2, quartam sic AB3, quintam sic AB4 atq3 ita deinceps.

Ubi notes quod pars positiva ducta in subductitiam vel subductitia in positivam producit subductitiam duæ vero subductitiæ in se ductæ producunt positivam.  secentur AB AD parallelis BD, EG ita ut sit AB ad AD ut AE ad AG et posita AB mensura illa ad quam lineæ omnes referuntur AG erit AD'AE.

[98] Notis proscognitis præmittenda est etiam methodus determinandi fluxiones linearum et fluxionum plagas. Per Fluxionem intelligo celeritatem incrementi vel decrementio lineæ cujusvis indeterminatæ ubi lineæ aliquæ super alias in descriptione curvarum moveri concipiantur et inter movendum augeri vel diminui aut motu punctorum describi. Unde et indeterminatas illas quantitates fluentes nominare licebit. Proponantur datæ aliquot quantitates A, B, C, D, et fluentes V X, Y, Z quarum fluxiones respectivè designent minusculæ v, x, y, z. et requiratur fluxio linea alicujus quæ ex his fit ut linea X'Y. < insertion from lower down f 134v >  Maneat primum X et fluat Y donec ipsa fiat Z et XY fiat XZ et quia Y et XY fluendo non mutant rationem fluxiones earum erunt ut ipsæ hoc est ut 1 ad X. Unde cum fluxio Y sit y fluxio XY erit Xy. Maneat jam Z et fluat X donec ipsa fiat V et XZ fiat VZ et fluxio XZ eri{t} Zx ut in casu priore. Fluant jam X et Y simul priore ut XV una vice fiat VZ et quia fluxio Xy sufficit ad mutandum XY in XZ et fluxio Zx ad mutandum XZ in VZ Fluxio tota qua XY mutatur in VZ erit Xy+Zx. Pone V æqualem X et Z æqualem Y ut fit ipso fluendi initio et fluxio initialis ipsius XY erit Xy+Yx.
Proponatur jam factum XYZ et ponendo XY=V erit XYZ=VZ. Cujus fluxio juxta casum priore{s} est Vz+Zv.Sed et ob XY=V est Xy+Y{X}=v. Pro V et v {sublimus} æquipollentia et Vz+Zv hoc est fluxio ipsius XYZ fiet XYz+XZy+YZx. Et progressionis modum observando colligitur universalitur quod facti cujuscunq3 fluxio invenietur substituendo sigillatim in facto illo pro unoquo{q3} factore {fluxionem} ejus et {sumendo resublantium} terminorum aggregatum. Qu{ot} regula < text from f 135r resumes > 
Simili argumentatione fluxio ipsius XYZ invenietur XYz+XZy+YZx et fluxio ipsius VXYZ invenietur VXYz +VXZy+VYZx+XYZv et sic in infinitum flu{xio} fasti semper invenietur substituendo sigillatim pro unoquoq3 factore fluxionem ejus et sumendo resultantiun terminorum aggregatam. Quæ regula 
<136r> etiam obtinet ubi aliqui factores æquales sunt. Ut si X et y æquales  ut XY valeat X2 ejus fluxio Xy+ Yx fiet 2Xx. Et similiter ipsius X3 fluxio est 3X2x et ipsius X2Z fluxio X2z+2XZx. Atq3 ita in compositis fluxio ipsius AX−3X2 est Ax−6Xx Nam fluxiones partium simul sumptæ sunt fluxio totius.
In lateribus applicatorum ad fluentia methodus hæc est Proponatur latus . Pone ipsum æquale V et erit XX=YV adeoq3 2Xx=Yv+Vy nam fluentium semper æqualium fluxiones æquales sunt. Aufer utrobiq3 Vy et reliquum divisum per Y nempe  erit v. Est autem v ipsius V id est ipsius  fluxio quam invenire oportuit.
Similis est methodus in lateribus {quadraticis}, {cubicin} alijsq3. . Proponatur latus AX-X2|. Pone ipsum æquale V, et erit AX-X2=V2 adeoq3 Ax−2Xx=2Vv, et .

In figuris pro significanda fluxione lineæ alicujus pono lineam ileam literis minusculis: ut bc pro significanda fluxione lineæ BC. Angulorum verò fluxiones expono per fluxiones arcuum quibus subtenduntur ad datam distantiam. Et distantiam illam quæcunq3 tandem assumatur designe per literam R; fluxionem arcus per angulum literis minusculis serpentum, opposit{a}m ordinatat{i}m applicatam in hoc circuloid est {s} sinum cujus arcus per literam s angulo præfixam distantiam ordinatæ {illeg} {centro} id est sinum complemen{illeg} {rationis} per literam s angulo præfixam & horum senuum fluxio s per literas easdem s it {'s}angulo minusculis literis not{illeg}o {præteras}. Sit ABC angulus quilibet {flucus} DC arcus {s}uo ad {datam} {distantis} Bc subtendit{c} & DE [ sinus ejus et significabit sustantiam illam datam BC vel BD, {I} vel abc fluxio{n}e arcus CD, sB lineam DE, s'B lineam BE{&}sb s'b earum fluxiones 
<138r>
Illud etiam præmittenduni est, fluxionem arcus esse ad fluxionem sinus ejus ut Radius ad sinum complementi et ad defluxionem sinus complementi ut radius ad sinum. ad sb ut R ad s'B et b ad−s'b ut R ad sB. Fluant enim omnes aliquantulum donec CD fiat CF, DE fiat FG et CE fiat CG et ipso fluendi initio fluxiones erunt ut augmenta incipientia FD, FH, HD id est ut BD, BE, DE.
His præmissis proponatur triangulum aliquod ABC et demissis ad latera singula perpendiculis AE, BF, CG ut sA ad sB ita BF, ad AE & ita BC ad AC adeoq3 sA'AC=sB'BC. Ergo sA'ac+AC'sa =sB'bc+BC'sb. Sed sa.a∷s'A.R∷AG.Ac Ergo AC'sa=AG'a. Et eodem modo est BC'sb= BG'b. Quare sA'ac+AG'a=sB'bc+BG'b. Quo theoremate conferre possumus fluxiones angulorum duorum et laterum oppositorum trianguli cujuscunq3 et ex tribus cognitis invenire quartam.
* < insertion from f 137v > * Et cum summa trium angulorum detur adeoq3 aggregatum fluxiorum omnium nullum sit, vel quod perinde est duorum fluxio æqualis sit defluxioni tertij si pro +BG'b scribas −BG'a+c, & idem utrobiq3 auferas fiet sA'ac+AB'a+BG'c=sB'bc, Theorema ad comparandas fluxiones duorum angulorum totidemq3 laterum quorum unum angulis illis in terijcitur. < text from f 138r resumes > 
Rursus * est R.s'A∷AC.AG seu s'A'AC=R'AG. Ergo s'A'ac+AC's'a=R'ag. Est et (per Præmissa) a.−s'a vel −a.s'a∷R.sA∷AC.CG. Ergo pro AC's'a scribendo −CG'a, fit s'A'ac−CG'a=R'ag. Eodem modo est s'B'bc−CG'b=R'bg. Et æqualibus æqualia addendo fit s'A'ac+s'B'bc−CG'a+b=R'ab. Ob datam summa trium angulorum pro a+b scribe −c et fit s'A'ac+s'B'bc+CG'c=R'ab. Theorema ad comparandas fluxiones trium laterum et anguli cujusvis.
< insertion from f 137v >
Simili argumentatione possunt alia Theoremata colligi [100] ubi perpendicula triangulorum et segmenta basium aliæve lineæ considerantur. Sic AC'ac−BC'bc+BG'ab=AB'ag Theorema est ubi latera tria et segmentum basis considerantur, et, posito X commmunni trium perpendiculorum intersectione, est BX'ac +AX'bc=GX'ab+AB'gc Theorema ubi agitur de lateribus ut perpendiculo. Sed hæc non prosequor. Satis est investigandi methodum aperuisse.
[101] Horum verò Theorematum beneficio possumus in propositus {illeg} quibus{illeg} figuris fluxiones linearum et angulorum haud secus ac in computo trigonometric{os} lias ab alijs colligere donec ad quæsitam pervenimus. Ut si dentur positione lineæ AB, AD, DE et BC data longitudinis moveatur perpetuo subtendæts angulum A <138v> et producta secans rectam ED in E, et ex cognita vel desideretur fluxio lineæ EC: primum in trianguli ABC per secundum Theorematum invenietur sA'ac+BG'c=0 evanescunt enim termi{ni}

De mottum plaga et celeritate
<143r> 

Propo
<145r>
In figuris hæc est methodus. Puncti mobilis considero semper motus diversos juxta diversas plagas quarum principalis sit via puncti. Et hos motus expono vel saltem exponi imaginor describendo per punctum illud circulum quemvis cujus centrum sit in via illa et in singulis plagis ducendo rectas usq3 ad hunc circulum. Ut si punctum A moveaur in linea BA, per illud A decribo circulum quemvis cujus centrum sit in BA et cui illa BA aliæqq3 lineæ quævis CA, DA, EA occurrant in F, G, H, I, et linearum partes intra circulus AF, AG, AH, AI erunt inter se ut motus puncti A in illarum plagis. Adeo ut si motus puncti A a B exponitur per AF, motus ejus a C exponatur per AG et sic in reliquis: Aut quod perinde est si fluxio lineæ BA ex parte termini A exponitur per AF, aliarum linearum CA, DA ad idem mobile punctum A semper desinentium fluxiones ex parte termini illius A exponantur per AG AH, et lineæ EA defluxio per AI. Unde ex cogniis motibus duorum punctorum ad quæ linea quævis utrinq3 terminatur, cognoscetur et exponi potest ejus fluxio absoluta: quippe quæ summa est fluxiorum ejus ad utrumq3 terminum, vel excessus fluxionis ad unum terminum supra defluxionem ad alterum. 
Porro motus punctorum circa  polos quosvis ijdem sunt et easdem habent exponentes ac motus in plagis perpendicularibus ad radios. Sic motus puncti A cirum quemvis in linea CA situm exponens est normalis AK circulo occurrens in K. Expositis vereo duorum punctorum rectæ cujusvis motibus circumpolaribus, recta alia per terminos exponentium acta secabit rectam illam in Polo suo. Et per harum exponentium rationem ad radios id est ad distantias suas a Polo, exponere licebit motum angularem hujus rectæ seu fluxionem angulorum quos ea cum rectis positione datis continet.
Et ut ex motibus punctorum invenire et exponi possunt fluxiones linearum et angulorum sec vice versa ex horum fluxionibus colligere licet motus punctorum. Nimirum considerando lineam AF in qua punctum quodvis A movetur ut exponentem motus ejus, et exponentis illus terminum ulteriorem F ut metam ad quam punctum illud A tendit{,} et lineas omnes FA, FG, FH, FI per metam transient{i}s ut {loca} rectæ ex inventione duorum ejusmodi locorum, meta quas {illeg} utrasque inter intersectione est determinabitur. Loca verò si invenientur. < insertion from lower down f 144v > Quando mobile punctum ex assumptione duarum quarum vis vel plurium {illeg} determinatum et stabile redditur, invenien{dus} est motus quem punctum illud haberet si una quantitatum assumeretur et alterius tantum vel reliquarum fluxio maneret et motûs illius quoad plagam et quantitatem exponens ducenda est. Cognoscenda est etiam plaga motus <145v> quem punctum idem haberet si vice versa illa una quantitas flueret et altera vel reliquæ assumerentur. Et in plaga illa per terminum exponentis acta recta erit unus {illeg} locis metæ. < text from f 145r resumes > 
Hoc modo a motibus punctorum ad fluxiones quantitatus et vicissim ab harum fluxionibus ad illorum motus pergelicebit donec quoadusq3 libuerit perventum sit. Et ubi exponens motus puncti curvam propositam describentis inventa est, hæc et cuevam in puncto illo tanget et exponens erit fluxionis ejus. Sed res exemplis clarior fiet.
<147r>
A mobili puncto A qua curva quævis  EA describitur ad rectas duas positione datas DB, DC in datis angulis ducuntur rectæ duæ AB AC et ductarum relatio ad invicem habetur. Ducenda est recta quæ curvam hanc tangat in A.
Ut hot fiat exponentur ductarum fluxiones per AG et AH. Jam quia punctum A, assumptione fluentium DB, BA determinatur, et ubi earum una DB assumitur et altera BA solummodo fluit, linea AG exponens est tam motus puncti quam fluxionis lineæ BA, ubi vero vice versa altera BA assumitur el prior DB fluit punctum A movetur in plaga lineæ DB, recta GF quæ per exponentis terminum G in plaga lineæ DB parallela ducitur erit unus locus Metæ. Et simili argumento recta HF quæ per exponentis AH terminum H in plaga lineæ DC ducitur erit alias locus Metæ. Et locorum intersectio F metam dabit ad quam tangens quæsita AF ducenda est. Quam conclusionem sic concinnare licebit. Lecet tangens rectam DB in M et ipsi DC parallela agatur MN occurrens AC in N et AB, AM, AN erunt inter se ut AG, AF, AH, adeoq3 vice exponentium AG, AH adhiberi possunt AB, AN: qua ratione longitudo AN atq3 adeo punctum M ad quod tangens duci debet invenietur.
Ut is relatio inter AB et AC sit quod rectangulum sub AC et data quavis recta R æquales sit quadrato AB2, æquales erunt etiam horum fluxiones R' ac & 2AB'ab{.} Hic Pro fluxionibus ac et ab substitue earum exponentes AH, AHvel potius harum vice lineas AN, AB, et fiet R'AN=2AB2. Unde R'AN et 2R'AC æquales sunt utpote eidem 2AB2 æquales; adeoq3 AN=2AC. Cape ergo CN=AC&Per N ipsi CD parallelam age NM occurrentem DB in M et recta AM curvam propositam tanget in A.
Hand secus si ad definendam relationem inter AB et AC ponatur R'AC−AC2 esse ad AB2 in data ratione, colligentur horum fluxiones R'ac−2AC'ac & 2AC'ab & 2AB'ab, et inde R'AN−2AC'AN in eadem ratione. Unde R'AC−AC2 &  æqualia erunt, utpote eandem rationem ad AB2 habentia. Caiatur ergo AN ad AC ut R-AC ad  et, actâ MN parallelâ CD, habebitur tangens AM. Porrò Curvæ EA hc sit propietas ut si a dato circulo FK per data puncta P, Q  ducantur rectæ duæ LI, LK, concurrentes ad dat{illeg} circulum EL, ponatur AB æqualis LG et AC æqualis LK: ducantur circulorum tangentes IM KN, LR et fluxio arcus ER exponatur per LR cujusvis{.} longitudinis. Super diametro LR describatur circulus secans PL productam in S et QL in T{,} et erit LS exponens fluxionis rectæ PL et LT exponens fluxionis retrogradæ rectæ QL. Erigantur normales LV ad LP et LX ad LQ 
<148r> occurrentes circulo LTR in V et X et erunt hæ exponentes motuum puncti L circa polos P et Q. Erigantur etiam normales YI ad PI et ZK ad QK ita ut sit YI ad IP ut VL ad LP et ZK ad KQ ut XL ad LQ et erunt hæ exponentes motuum punctorum I et K circa polos eosdem P et Q. Concipe per puncta I et Y circulum describi cujus centrum sit in tangente IM et pariter per puncta K et Z alium circulus cujus centrum sit in tangente KN, et horum circulorum diametri IM KN exponentes erunt motuum punctorum I et K in circumferentia circuli JK: item YM æqualis erit exponenti fluxionis lunæ PI et ZN æqualis exponenti fluxionis totius IL et TL+ZN exponens fluxionis retrogradæ totius KL. Cape ergo AG=SL+YM et AH=LF+ZN, sed of fluxionem retrogradam ipsius LK vel AC cape AH ad partes ipsius A versus C, et HF acta parallela DC secabit GF actam parallelam DB in Meta F ad quam tangens quæsita AF duci debet.
Quod si vice rectarum LI, LK adhibeantur circulorum arcus EL, FK ponendo AB æqualem arcui EL et AC æqualem arcui FK, tunc AG sumenda erit æqualis LR et AH æqualis KN, eo quod LR exponens sit fluxionis arcus EL et KN exponens defluxionis arcus FK, et actæ GF, HF ut prius tangentem determinabunt. Neq3 problema difficilius erit si vice circulorum EL FK adhibeantur aliæ quævis curvæ lineæ quarum tangentes LR, KN ductæ habentur. Sed et alijs modis innumerris relatio inter AB et AC exprimi potest, imò et vice rectarum DB, DC curvæ quvis adhiberi ad quas AB, AC ducantur in datis plagis et quarum tangentes ad puncta B et C sint DB et DC. 
Ducatur verò jam linea DB, DC non in datis plagis sed ad data puncta B et C, et earum  fluxiones exponantur per AG et AH. Et quoniam assumptione anguli ABC et longitudinis BA determinatur punctum A, et ubi angulus ille solummodo assumitur exponens motus puncti A est linea AG, ubi vero e{illeg} tra angulus ille fluit et longitudo BA ass{mi}tur plaga motus puncti A perpendicularis est ad BA, recta GF in plaga illa per exponentis terminum G ducta erit unus locus {metæ}. Et simili argumento recta HF per {t}erminum exponentis AH in plaga perpendiculari ad CA ducta erit alius locus 
<149r> Metæ. Et meta in utroq3 loco consistens erit in eorum inter sectione F, adeoq3 AF ad intersectionem illam ducta curvam motu puncti A descriptam tanget in A.
Ut si ea sit natura curva hujus ut summa vel differentia fluentis AB et datæ cujusvis R sit ad fluentem AC in data ratione (qui casus est quatuor Ovalium Cartesij) fluxiones illarum AB et AC erunt in eadem data ratione, adeoq3 si in plagis fluxionum illarum capiantur AG AH vel quod perinde est si in plagis contrarijs capiantur An et AC in illa ratione et ad terminos captarum erigantur perpendicula concurrentia in F vel M acta AF vel AM curvam propositam tanget in A. Unde si ratio illa æqualitatis (qui casus est Hyperbolæ et Ellipsis) tangens bisecabit angulum CAN.
Ponamus jam super plano immobili in quo puncta P et K et recta infinita KD positione data habentur, planum mobile BCA curva aliqua CA terminatum, ita ferri ut recta BC in eo data semper coincidat cum recta KD, et interea secum trahere regulam PB per punctum suum B perpetuo transeuntem et circa polum P rotantem , & ejus intersectione cum termino suo curvilineo CA describere curvam lineam PAL in plano immobili{,} et requiratur hujus curvæ tangens ad punctum quodvis A. Quoniam  assumptione rectæ KC et curvæ CA det{u}rminatur punctum A assumatur solummodo curva AC et sit CQ exponens fluxionis lineæ KC et huic parællela et æqualis AG exponens erit motus puncti A, et GF duct{o} in plaga motus quem punctum A haberet si vice versa KC assumeretur et curva CA solummodo flueret id est ducta parallela rectæ AD qu{æ} curvam AC tangit in A, erit unus locus metæ. Rursus quoniam punctum A assumptione longitudinis KB et proportionis PA ad PB determinatur, assumamus solummodo proportionem illam et punctum movebit in linea AG erit motus ejus ad motum puncti B ut PA ad PB. Exponatur ergo motus ejus per AH quæ sit ad alterius exponentem id est ad CQ vel AG ut PA ad PB, et per punctum H in plaga motus 
<150r> quem haberet punctum A si vice versa KB assumeretur et ratio PA ad PB flueret, id est parallela PB acta recta HF erit alter locus metæ. Habetis autem duobus metæ locis habetur Meta in eorum intersectione F una cum tangente AF quæ ad metam duci debet. Quæm conclusionem si concinare animus est, produc tangentem donec secet BK in N, et ob similes figuras AFGH, NADB erit BN ad BD ut AH ad HG hoc est ut AP ad AB
Ut si Curva CA Parabola sit cujus vertex C diameter CK ordinatim applicata AI, (quo casu AL Parabola erit Cartesij) imprimis ducenda erit AD quæ Parabolam CA tangat in A quod fiet si capiatur CD æqualis CI, dein capiend{à} est BN ad BD ut AP ad AB et acta AN tanget curvam AL in A.
Quod si AC circulus sit centro B descriptus, quo casu AL Conchoides erit Veterum, erigenda est  ad AP normalis AD occurrens BN in D, hàc enim circulum illum tanget. Dein capienda est BN ad BD ut AP ad AB. Vel brevius capienda est BM=AP et erigenda normalis MN occurrens BD in N et acta AN figuram AL tanget in A.

Genera Line{a}rum ejusdem {O}rdinis Si linea aliqua oculo extra planum ejus sito spectetur per planum translucidum, et in plano illo locus ejus apparens vel (ut voce mathematica utamur) projectio notetur, erit linea projecta ejusdm ordinis cum projiciente. Si projiciens est recta projectio erit recta, si curva est quæ rectam secare potest in duobus vel pluribus punctis, projectios ejus projectionem rectæ in totidem punctis secare potest. Et hinc habita linea aliqua cujusvis ordinis possunt aliæ plures ejusdem ordinis inde derivari. Sic Veteres ex circulo derivarunt omnes secundi ordinis figuras et inde Conicas sectiones nominarunt, considerantes spatium illud solidium quod radijs per circuli spretati perimetrum transeuntibus terminatur ut conum quem planum figuræ projectæ secat. Sic et figuræ superiorum ordinum possunt omnes a simplicioribus quibusdam ejusdem ordinis figuris per successivas projectiones derivari et inde distingui in genera coordinata positis illis ejusdem esse generis quæ ab eadem figura derivantur. Nam hæ omnes & solæ in se mutuò per projectiones transeunt et ea ratione cognotæ sunt, a cæteris verò in quas non transeunt alienæ. Hac lege unicum tantum est genus linearum secundi ordinis, eo quod omnes derivantur a circulo: at ordinis tertij genera sunt quinq3.
[107] In recta infinita EAB dentur puncta  duo A, E et ad tertium quodvis ejus punctum B in dato angulo erigatur ordinata. BC cujus quadratum, si præterea dentur rectæ duæ M et N, æquale fuerit . Et curva linea ad quam hujusmodi recta omnis BC terminatur erit Parabola a{illeg}ta Parabolæ casus sunt quinq3 principales; primus et simplicissimus ubi linea N nulla est: Secundus ac tertius ubi N negativè ponitur et præterea AE est , et secundus quidem ubi AE capitur ab A versus D seu versus alas figuræ, tertius verò ubi AE capitur ad contrarias partes ipsius A: Quartus et quintus sunt ubi AB est atrius{,} cujusvis longitudinis {illeg} ubi Parabola illa secas lineam utrinq3 {illeg} puncto quintus verò {illeg} tribus{.} Primo casu habetur Parabola Neiliana cujus utiq3 longitudinem ubi {illeg} {Neilius noster primus} invenit: secundo haetur, Parabola {illeg} {illeg} longitudinis parabola {campani} formis {illeg} {um} habens conjuga{illeg} {um:} {puncto parabola cum jam formis} solitaria quinto Parabola {illeg} {sum} Ellipsi habens conjugata quæ si in punctum {contragitur} {illeg} illud conjugatum in casu tertio.

<154r>
[108] Quinetiam per casus Projectionum distinguuntur genera linearum in species. Nomine{nuis} planum illud Horizontem quod per oculum transit et plano lineæ projectæ parallelum est, et lineam illam Horizontalem in qua Horizon secat planum lineæ projicientis. Et linea omnis projiciens dubit tot projectionum species quot sunt casus positionum lineæ Horizontalis. Si linea Horizontalis alicubi secat projicientem intersectio illa generabit in projectione cruræ duo Hyperbolici generis cirva eandem Asymptoton ad oppositas plagas in infinitum tendentia, idq3 ex eodem Asymptoti latere si intersectio sit in puncto flexus contrarij, aliter ex latere diverso, et Asymptotos erit projectio rectæ quæ curvam projicientem tangit in puncto intersectionis, totq3 ejusmodi crurum paria in projectione quot sunt intersectiones lineæ Horizontalis cum projiciente. Unde linea secundi ordinis non nisi duo paria crurum Hyperbolicorum habere potest, Linea tertij ordinis non trisi tria paria {L}inea quarti quatuor &c; et earum Asymptoti tris vel plures se secabunt in uno punct{o} si tangentes se secant in uno, {illeg} {illeg}bus vel pluribus; & si Projicit{u}r {illeg} {senel} vel {illeg} {illeg} secat in puncto dec{crissatioris,} {illeg} duæ {illeg} parallelæ {erunt}.
Si Linea Horizontalis {illeg} ge{n}erunt crura duo Parabol{illeg} generis ad eadem pla{illeg} in infi{tum} {illeg} et concavis partibus {illeg} {illeg}picientia, {insi} ubi cont{illeg} {illeg} est {illeg} puncto {illeg}casa crura Parab{illeg} ad mod{illeg} celerum {illeg} oppo{illeg} et ex eodem latere {concave} erunt {illeg} vertice {cento} curva alicujus {illeg} quum obliquissimè tangit Projicie{n}tem seu ut {projiriè} {illeg} angulo contactus crura Parabolica {illeg} ad pla{gas} oppositas {ut si} di{illeg} latere concavæ erunt, at si tangit ipsam {illeg} angulo qui rectilineo æqualis <155r> sit contactas ille generabit crura duo Hyperbolica ex eodem latere ejusdem Asumptoti ad eandem plagam in infinitum tendentia.
Si linea Horizontalis et Asymptotos Projicientis crura Hyperbolica quæ circa Asymptoton illam sunt, convertentur in Parabolica: Et vice versa si linea Horizontalis tendit ad plagam crurum Parabolicorum crura illa convertentur in Hyperbolica. Omnia vero crura infinita quæ non tendunt ad plagam lineæ horizontalis in omni casu evanescunt.
Si deniq3 Linea Horizontalis transit per punctum conjugatum, generabitur curva linea cujus punctum conjugatum in infinitum abijt. Et ne punctum conjugatum infinite distans absurdum videatur scias projectiones hujus curvæ haberæ puncta conjugata finitè distantia quæ sunt puncti illius infinitè distantis projectiones.
Atq3 hæ sunt mutationes li curvarum linearum quæ projectione fiunt: quarum casus omnes et eorum complexiones siquis ad curvam aliquam projicientem enumeraverit, is simul enumerabit linearum species omnes quæ sunt ejusdem generis cum projiciente: saltem si in lineis altiorum ordinum Projicius satis latè sumitur.
[109] Sic ubi Projiciens est circulus, Linea Horizontalis hunc circulum aut secabit in duobus punctis aut tanget in uno aut tota cadet extra circulum, et perinde Projectio aut quatuor habebit infinita crura Hyperbolica aut duo Parabolica aut nullum. Unde hujus ordinis tres erunt species Hyperbla Parabola et Ellipsis præter Circulum. At in generibus linearum tertij ordinis casus sunt plures
In primo Genere
[110] 1. Si oculus infinitè distat, vel si planum projectionis plano projicientis parallelum est, projectio erit Parabola ejusdem speciei cum projiciente id est Parabola cuspidata quam Neilianam nominavimus. .
2. Si Linea Horizontalis transit per verticem cuspidatum Projicientis idq3 in angulo contactus, Projectio erit Parabola Wallisiana, habens crura duo Parabolica ad oppositas plagas in infinitum tendentia et ex diverso latere concava. et centrum in puncto flexus contrarij.
3. Si linea illa Horizontalis transit per verticem cuspidatum et tendit ad plagam infinitorum crurum Projicientis Projectio erit Crux Hyperbolica librata, habens duas Hyperbolas ex eodem habere unius Asymptoti ex diverso alterius. Libratam vero {vaco} {illeg} curvam quæ diametrum {illeg} rectiineam habet ordinatas {illeg}inde æquales terminantem: non {illeg} quæ {illeg}
4. Si linea illa transi{bis} {illeg} cuspidatum tendit ad aliam quamvis plagam: Projectio {illeg} hyperbolica non lineata habens Hyperbolas duas {duarum} duo crura ex diverso latere unius {illeg} ad {eandem plagam} altera duo ex diverso latere {deterius} {illeg}proti ad plagas oppositas tendunt. 
5. Si tendit ad plagam crurum infinitorum et Projicientem nec secat nec tangit Projectio erit Cisso{i}s librata, et uno casu Cissois

The pricked circle is the Moon according to the parallex of M.C. 46′.20″. And so the digits by the type are 11.43′. which were observed 11.22. The luminous part alwayes seemeth broader than it is.
{In this Type the Sun standeth as in the former, for the time is the same. Now because then was the greatest Observation, it is manifest that the  was then at s, k not at q where the Tables place it. the Tables gô give the  9' too must in Longitude, as you may measure with your compasses in this Type.}

For the Altitude of the Sun
Ut rad. ab sim. anguli orientis: ita sinus distantiæ  a Decendente ad sim alt.  41.50′.
In the same manner I find the altitude of the next superiour degree in the Ecliptic to be 41.54′. & the altitude of the next inferiour degree to be 41.45′. The one being 4′ more than the Suns altitude, & the other 5′ lesse; I take the meane &c.  for the distance of the Almicenters, sc. of the Almic. of the Sun, & the Almic. that cutts the Ecliptic either one degree before the Sun, or one degree behind him. & this number  I keep
Now I trace a line (AB) for the moones Orbit. & because the Eclipse hapneth in the 9th degree from  I prick that degree behoren 8 & 9 from a scale of one degree, or from my Sector set for the purpose, by where I can measure with my compasses to the 6 part of a minute. The Lat. of 8°. is 43′.58″. I take it into my compasses from my Scale or Sector & setting one foot in 8 of the Orbit with the other I draw the arch about h. & the Lat. of 9° being 49′.20″ I take likewise & setting one foot in 9 of the Orbit I draw a second arch below the Orbit. & by the outsides of these arches I draw the Ecliptic in his true situation.
Then from 8 in the Orbit I let fall a perpendicular (8h) upon the Ecliptic. which perpendicular falleth short of 8 in the Ecliptic by the quantity of the Reduction, which here is h 8 being 2′.03″. set 8 therefore in the Ecliptic so much to the left hand (s.s.s.) from the perpendic. & 60 minutes furtherest 9.
Then I prick the center of the Sun upon the Ecliptic 30′.34″. from 8 toward 9. & I prick the  in her Orbit 41′.06″ from 8 toward 9.
From the Sun measure one degree in the Ecliptic bd. Take in your compasses the . before {illeg}ned for this purpose, & setting one foot in d, with the other draw the arch at e. & laying a ruler to the Sun & to the outside of this arch draw a strait line which shall be the Almicenter of the Sun. Then from the Sun raise a perpendicular at right angles with the said Almicenter, & it shall be the Azimuth of the Sun. & draw a parallell thereto through the Moones {illeg}in her Orbit, & that shall be the Azimuth of the Moones.
I measure from the Ecliptic downward in the Suns Azimuth so much as his parallax of {altit.} comes to (which here is 45″) & there set the apparent center of the sun (as at c) & there upon with his semidiameter 15′.12″ I draw his circle. Also from the Moones place in her Orbit {her} Azimuth I measure her parallax of alt. and (m n being 46′.20″. according to my Tables & where the parallax ends prick the moones apparent center (at n. ) & there{illeg} with her semidiameter (16′.10″.) describe her circle.
{illeg} you a perfect type in which you may measure with your compasses what you will and if you would know the posture of the Luminaryes an hours or half or quarter {illeg} or before prick the points of 8 & 9 into another paper. & by these points draw {illeg} {illeg} then rectifie the places of the Sun & moone by adding or subtracting the {illeg} {illeg}here you must a{illeg} {illeg} orient angle, & altitude of the Sun {illeg} {illeg} the distance of the {illeg} {illeg} labour of {illeg} {illeg}

'Of Colours'
<1>
Of Colours.
1. The rays reflected from Leafe Gold are yellow but then transmitted are blew, as appears by holding a leafe of Gold twixt your eye & a candle.
2. Lignum Nephriticum sliced & about a handfull infused in 3 or 4 pints of faire water for a night the liquor (looked on in a cleare violl) reflects blew rays & transmits yellow ones. And if the liquor being too much impregnated appeares (when looked through) of a darke red it may be diluted with faire water till it appeare of a Golden Colour.
3 The flat peices of some kinds of Glase will exhibit the same Phænomena with Lignum Nephritcum And these Phænomena of Gold & Lignum Nephriticum are represented by the Prisme in the 37th experiment as also in the 22th & 24th Experiment.
4 But Generally bodys which appeare of any colour to the eye, appeare of the same colour in all positions; {Nay} Gold if it bee not soe very thin as to bee transparent appeares onely yellow & perhaps the yellow colour of Lignum Nephriticum would vanish if the tincture bee strong & the liquor of a greate thicknesse. And perhaps there are many coloured bodys which if made so thin as to bee transparent would appeare of one colour when looked upon & of another colour when looked through. Perhaps Motes in the Sun doe so for they appeare coloured. And
5 The tincture of Lignum Nephriticum may bee deprived of its blew colour without any alteration made in the yellow. by putting a little of any acid salt into it (as spirit of Salt of vinegar, of Lemon juice, oyle of Vitrioll, Aqua fortis &c). Sulphureous Salts (whither Vrinous (i.e. Volatile salts of Animal substances) as Spirit of hartshorne of Vrin; of blood, of Sal Armoniack; Or Lixiviate Vnctuous Alcalizate & fixed salts made by incineration as the Solution of Salt of potashes, of common wood ashes, of lime water, Oyle of Tartar &c) doe restore the blew colour without making any change in the yellow.

Experiments with the Prisme
On a black peice of paper I drew a line opq, whereof one halfe op was a good blew the other pq a good deepe red (chosen by Prob. of Colours). And looking on it through the Prisme adf, it appeared broken in two twixt the colours, as at rst, the blew parte rs being nearer the vertex ab of the Prisme than the red parte st. Soe that blew rays suffer a greater refraction than red ones. Note I call those blew or red rays &c, which make the Phantome of such colours.
The same Experiment may bee tryed with a thred of two colours held against the darke.
7 Taking a Prisme, (whose angle fbd was about 60dr into a darke roome into which the sun shone only at one little round hole k. And laying it close to the hole k in such manner that the rays, being equally refracted at (n & h) their going in & out of it, cast colours rstv on the opposite wall. The colours should have beene in a round circle were all the rays alike refracted, but their forme was oblong terminated at theire sides r & s with streight lines; theire bredth rs being 2 inches, theire length to about 7 or eight inches, & the centers of the red & blew (q & p) being distant about 2 or 3 inches. The distance of the wall trsv from the Prisme being 260 inches
8 Setting the Prisme in the midst twixt the hole k & the opposite wall, in the same posture, & laying a boarde xy betwixt the hole k & the Prisme close to the Prisme, in which board there was a small hole as big as the hole k (viz:  of an inch in Diameter) so that the rays passing through both those holes to the Prisme might all bee almost parallel (wanting lesse than 7 minutes, whereas in the former experiment some rays were inclined 31min). Then was the length & breadth of the colours on the wall every way lesse than halfe the former by about 2 inches viz rs =  inch, tv = 2inch . & pq = 1 inch Soe that the Red & blew rays which were parallel before refraction may bee esteemed to be <3> generally inclined one to another after refraction some more some lesse than) 34min. And that some of them are inclined more than a degree, in this case. And therefore if theire sines of incidence (out of glasse into aire) be of the same, theire sines of refraction will generally bee in the proportion of 285 to 286 & for the most extreamly red & blew rays, they will bee as 130 to 131 +, : ffor by experiment if their angle of incidence out of the glasse into the aire bee 30d. The angle refraction of the red rays being 48gr 35': the angle of refraction of the blew rays will bee 48gr, 52', generally but if the rays bee extreamly red & blew the angle of refraction of the blew rays may bee more than 49gr, 5'.
9 In the 7th Experiment the colours appeared in this order. but in the 8th experiment when the rays were more distinct & unmixed
10 Painting a good blew or red colour on a peice of paper neither of which was much more luminous than the other (for carrying them gadually into the darke, both grew faint alike almost & disappeared together) if the Prismaticall blew fell upon the colours thay both appeared perfectly blew but the red paint afforded much the fainter & darker blew, but if the Prismaticall red fell on the colours then both appeared perfectly red but the painted blew afforded much the fainter Red. The Prisme was ordered as in the 8th experiment. Note that the purer the Blew |  Red is the lesse tis visible with blew |  Red rays.
<4>
 11 If the plate abcdsr bee painted with any two colours & abcd bee the lighter colour, the partition edge of the Colours, cd will appeare through the prisme txy of a red colour, bu{t} if cres bee the lighter colour, their common edge cd 12 will through a prisme looke blew. 12 And this will happen though the colours differ not in species but only in degrees, as if acdb bee black & cdsr darkness or blacker than abdc the edge dc will bee red & much more conspicuous than the black, which is strange. 
13 But if in a darke roome (as in Experiment 10) the prismaticall blew or redd fall on a paper abdc the edges of the paper will not appeare otherwise coloured through another Prisme than to the naked eye, viz: of the same colour with the rest of the paper. [ffor the first Prisme perfectly seperats the blew & red rays whereas I beleive all the colours proper to bodys are a little mixed.]
14 Prismaticall colours appeare in the eye in a contrary order to that in which they fall on the paper.
15 If a foursquare vessell abcd bee made with two parallel sides of well pollished glasse AC BD, & bee filled with water; And if the sunns rays passing into a darke roome through the hole k doe fall very obliquely on the glasse sides of the vessell the rays at their egresse shall paint colours on the paper EF on which they fall. [The blew & red rays being seperated by the first refraction.]
16 The colours are not made broader (as they would {be} were the prisme triangular) by removing the paper farther from the vessell. [becaus the blew & red rays become parallell againe after the second refraction] if the rays pass through two holes near or close to the vessell on either side the colours
<5>
17 The window k being opened that the Sun or other terminated light might shine freely, If I limited the rays by an opace body held twixt the wall & the vessel the edge of the bodys shaddow would not appeare coloured. But if the said body were on that side the vessel towards the sun its shaddow would be coloured on its edge  
18. But in the Triangular Prisme whither the said body bee held on the one side or on the other the edges of its shaddow appeares coloured.
19. If you looke upon some uniformely luminous body (as on the cleare sky or a sheet of white paper &c) through a triangular prisme. & hold the said opace body on the farther side of the Prisme soe as to obscure parte of the said luminous body; the farther the said opace body is held from the Prisme, the more its edges will bee coloured; & the nearer, the lesse; untill the colours almost vanish when the said body is held close close to the Prisme.
20 But if instead of the triangular Prisme you use the said 4square vessell ABDC, held obliquely that the rays may bee much refracted in passing through it to the eye when the opake body is placed as neare to the {vessell} as you can distinctly see it, your eye being close to the  vessell, the edges of the said body will appeare coloured which colours are diminished by removing the body farther from the vessell, & quite vanish when the distance of the said body is very greate. Thus the Sun, by reason of his distance, appeares not coloured on his edges {illeg} when looked on through the said vessell, & yet in the 15th experiment hee trajects colours on a peice of paper.
{21} The colours made by this vessel appeare imediatly to the eye in the same order in which they fall on paper but by the  Prisme that order is divers.
{N}ote, That the more the glasse sides of the vessell ABCD are distant, {the} better it is; that distance should not bee lesse than 6 or 8 inches to make the Phænomena conspicuous. Some of the Phænomena may bee tryed by tying two Prismes thus  together: But the distance of theire sides is too little to exhibit them
<6>
22. If the sun S shine upon the Prism def, some of his rays being transmitted through the base ef will make colour on the wall cb at b, others will bee reflected to the wall at c making only a white without colours; Now if the Prisme bee soe inclined as that the rays ab bee refracted more & more obliquely, the blew colour will at last vanish from b; soe that the red alone being refracted to b, the blew will bee reflected to c & make the white colour there to appeare a litttle blewish. But if the Prisme bee yet more inclined, the red colour at b will vanish too & being reflected to c will make the blewish colour turne white againe.
23. If in the open aire you looke at the Image of the Sky reflected from the bases of the Prism ef, holding your eye O almost perpendicular to the basis you will see one part of the sky ep (being as it were shaded with a thin curtaine) to appeare darker than the other qf. [ ffor all the rays which can come to the eye from qf, fall soe obliquely on the basis as to bee all reflected to the eye. Whereas those which can come to the eye from ep are so direct to the basis as to bee most of them transmitted to g]: & the partition of those two parts of the Sky, pq, appeares blew; [ffor the rays , which can come to the eye from pq, are so inclined to the basis that all the blew rays are reflected to the eye whilst most of the red rays are transmitted through to g as in Experiment 22]
24 Tying two Prismes basis to basis def & bef together I so held them in the sun beames transmitted through a hole into a darke roome, that they <7> falling pretty directly upon the base ef (in fig 1) were most of them transmitted to B on the paper CB; though some of them were reflected to C by the filme of aire ef betwixt the Prismes.But both C & D were white Then I inclined the Basis (ef) of the Prismes more & more to the rays untill B changed from white to Red, & the white at C became blewish; & inclining the Prisme a little more the Red at B vanished, & the blewish colour at C became white againe. As in the 22th Experiment.
25 If I held the said Prismes in the open air as in the 23d experiment, holding my eye at O (in the 2d fig) to see the reflected sky the Phænomena were the same as in that 23d experiment; ep appearing darker than qf, & pq being blew. But if I held my eye at N to see the sky through the base of the Prismes ef (or rather through the plate of aire betwixt those bases) there appeared the contrary Phænomena but much more plaine ep being very light, qf very darke, & pq very red. [The reason was given in the 23d experiment
Note, That the 22th & 24th (& all such like experiments that require that the rays coming from a luminous body be all wholly or almost parallell) would bee more conspicuous were the suns Diameter lesse, & therefore for such like experiments his rays may bee straitned through two small holes at a good distance assunder, as was done in the 8th Experiment.
Also the 23th & 25t Experiment ( most other such like in which the rays passe immediatly from the prisme to the eye) would bee more conspicuous were the Pupill lesse than it is, And therefore it would bee convenient to looke through a small hole at the Prisme.
26 The colours in the portion pq appeared to the eye O in this order
<8>
27 The two Prismes being tyed together then in trying the 24th experiment, there appeared a white spot in the midst of the red colour B, & a darke spot in the blewish colour C. And after the base ef of the Prismes was more inclined to the rays , so that the red colour vanished & that (by the laws of Refraction) noe light could penetrate the filme of aire ef, yet the white spot remained at B & the darke one in the midst of the light at C.
28 Holding my eye at O or N (in trying the 25t Experiment) very obliquely to the basis ef; To my eye at O appeared a black spot (R) in the midst of the white basis (or filme of aire) ef, & to my eye at N appeared a white spot (R) in the midst of the black basis (or plate of aire) ef; through which spot (as through a hole in the midst of a black body) I could distinctly see any object, but could discerne nothing through any other parts of the appearingly blak basis ef.
29 By variously pressing the Prismes together at one end more than at another I could make the said spot R run from one place to another; & the harder I pressd the prismes together, the greater the spot would appeare. to bee. [Soe that I conceive the Prismes (their sides being a little convex & not perfectly plaine) pressed away the interjacent aire at R & becoming contiguous in that spot, transmitted the Rays in that place as if they had beene one continuous peice of glasse; whereas the plate of aire ef is a very reflecting body: soe that the spot R may bee called a hole made in the plate of aire (ef)].
32 The colours of the circles (in the 30th & 31th experiment) appeared more distinct at C than at B, & to the Eye O than to the Eye N. There being I conceive some colourlesse light reflected with the coloured light to O, & C but much more colourlesse light transmitted to N & B; which must needs whiten & blend the colours.
<9>
30 In the 27th Experiment when the colour white or red was trajected on B, there would apeare severall circles of colours about. the white spot at B & also about the da{rke} one at C. But these colours vanished together with the red colo{ur} at B: Growing greater & distincter untill they vanished.
31 Likewise in the 28th experiment when the spot was in that side the partition pq next the eye, it appeared to my eye both at O & N, encompassed with divers circles of colours. which circles would grow greater & distincter by how much the coloured partition pq came nearer & nearer to them (that is by how much the base ef was more & more oblique to the rays) & soe vanished by degrees as the said limb pq came to them. Before they began to vanish they appeared round or Ellipticall thus But in their vanishing (especially if looked {on} through a hole much smaller then my pupill) they appeared incurved thus. But I could see the most circles when I looked on them through a long slender slit, held parallel to the coloured limb pq, when the circles halfe disappeared: for then I have numbered 25 circles esteeming each consecution of red & blew to bee one circle & could perceive ther were many more so close together that I could not number them; whereas with my naked eye I could not discern above nine or ten .
33 The circles are the broadest nearest to the center & so beeing narrower & narrower doe (I conceive by the exactest measure I could make) increase in number as the interjacent aire doth in thicknesse. (Sit cd = radio curvitatis vitri; efghik circuli colorum; & el =  =  =  =  =  = crassitiei æris). And this I observed by a sphericall object-glasse of a Prospective tyed fast to a plaine glasse, so as to make the said spot with the circles of colours appeare
<10>
34 By the forenamed Prospective glasse I observed (though not very exactly) that the more obliquely the ray tc was incident to the filme of aire ef twixt the glasses, the greater the coloured circles are in this proportion: 
35 When the rays were perpendicular to the aire ef, the diameter of 5 of the circles was one parte, whereof 400 was the radius dC of the glasses curvity. the said radius being 25inches Soe that (el) the thicknesse of the aire for one circle was  inch or 0,000015625. [which is the space of the pulse of the vibrating medium.] by measuring it since more exactly I find  = to the said thicknesse.
36 Accordingly as the glasses are pressed more or lesse togeth{er} the coloured circles doe become greater or lesse. & as they are pressed more & more together new circles doe arrive in the midst untill at last the said pellucid spot R doth appeare.
37 The circles of colour appeare in this order from the center to the eye O Or on the paper at C viz Darke (or pellucid), white,        yellow, greene, blew, purple, Red, yellow, greene, blew purple, Red, yellow, Greene, blew &c. But to the eye N or on the Paper at B they appeare in this order Light (or pellucid) black,        blew, Greene, yellow, Red, purple, blew, greene                    soe that those circles which appeare Red to the eye O, appea{re} blew to the eye N, & thos which appeare blew to the eye O appeare of the contrary colour red to the Eye N
<11>
38 Those circles which appeare Red to the eye O, & blew to the eye N are almost as broade againe as those which appeare blew to the eye O & Red to the eye N.
39 Holding the said circles in a darke roome in the blew rays made by a Prisme (as the 10th Experiment) all the said circles appeared blew but those which in the discoloured light appeared red appeared of a blew much more diluted than the others. And if the Red Prismaticall rays fell upon those circles all the circles appeared red but those circles which in the clear light appeared blew, in the Prismaticall red rays appeared of a much darker & obscurer red than the others.
40 Whither these circles were held in the Prismaticall blew or red rays they still appeared of the same bignesse.
41 Putting water betwixt the two Prismes instead of the filme of aire; There appeared all the Phænom{ena} of the said circles, & also of the 22, 23, 24, & 25t Experiments &c. Onely somewhat more obscurely becaus there is lesse refraction made out of glasse into water than into aire; & yet
42 The coloured circles appeared as big when there was a filme of water as when there was a filme of aire betwixt the Prismes.
43 If you make the pellucid spot R nimbly to run to & fro. There will appeare another spot S to follow it, which spot S exhibits such Phænomena as it ought to doe were it a Spot of aire, viz: To the eye O it appeares white next the Spot R & then Red &c, But to the eye N it appeares black next the Spot R & then blew &c: which colours it ought to have were it a filme of aire (by experiment 37). But it is not a filme of aire because if the Spot R rests a little, the water creepes into the said spot S & makes it vanish. It seemes therefore that the water cannot nimbly enough follow the spot R, but leaves <12> the space S empty to bee possessed by Æther alone, untill the water have time to creepe into it.
44 Refracting the Rays through a Prisme into a darke rome (as in the 7th Experiment) And holding another Prisme about 5 or 6 yards from the former to refract the rays againe I found ffirst that the blew rays did suffer a greater Refraction by the second Prisme then the Red ones.
45 And secondly that the purely Red rays refracted by the second Prisme made noe other colours but Red & the purely blew ones noe other colours but blew ones.
46 If three or more Prismes A, B, C, bee held in the sun soe that the Red colour of the Prisme B falls upon the Greene or yellow colour of the Prisme A & the Red colour of the Prisme C falls on the Greene or yellow colour of the Prisme B; the said colours falling upon the Paper DE at P, Q, R, S. There will appeare a Red colour at P & a blew one at S but betwixt Q & R where the Reds, yellows, Greenes, blews, & Purples of the severall Prismes are blended together there appeares a white.
47 Or if you clean a peice of <13> Paper on one side of the Prisme with severall slits a, b, c, d, in it parallel to the edges of the Prisme soe that the light passing through those slits make colours on the Paper DE; If the said paper be held neare to the Prisme there will appeare for each slit a, b, c, d, a coloured line r, s, t, v. The paper being held farther of untill the said coloured lines bee blended together, there will appeare white twixt p & q where those colours are blended; at m there appeares Reds & at n blews. But if the paper bee still held farther of the white colour (pq) will appeare narrower & narrower untill it vanish. & then gh on one side appeares Red & gf on the other side is blew.
49 A single superficies of Glasse reflects many rays whither they passe out of glasse into aire or out of aire into Glasse & yet two surfaces of Glasse when contiguous (by the 27th 28th & 29th Experiment) reflect the Rays noe more then if the glasses had beene one entire peice without such a superficies betwixt them.
48 As white was made by a mixture of all sorts of colours (in the 46th & 47th Experiment) Greene is made by a mixture of blew & yellow, purple by a mixture of red & yellow, &c
50 Thin fflakes of Muscovy Glasse, Bubbles which children make of sope & water, the thin skums of molten leade, of cooling iron, water wiped very thin on glasse, glasse blowne very thin, &c represent the Phænomena of the coloured circles in the 30th and 31st Experiment &c. To which may bee referred coloured motes in the Sun or in liquors, or pouders, or sollid bodys; the slender coloured threds of some {illeg} cobwebbs, of silke wormes, & of flax finely dressed (though the flax in spining loseth its glosse, because the flat thredds cleave together againe into two greate a thicknesse see Experiment 49 )
<14>
51 If the Sun S shine upon a large glasse Globe abd filled with water And if you hold your eye very neare to the globe, the rays bp will appeare coloured redd & the farther you hold your eye from the glasse the lesse they appeare coloured, untill the colour vanish. But the Rays rd & fq appeare coloured at what distance so ever your eye bee placed from the Globe. The like you may observe by letting the colours fall on a peice of paper.
52 Though one termination of light trajected through the Prisme will not make both blews & reds; yet in this globe it doth (see Cartesij Meteora cap 8 sec 9) ffor the rays rd & fq make all sorts of blews & reds; indeed by the rays bp the red is very distinct but the blew is scarce discernable.
53 The colours of the Rainbow must bee explicated by the rays rd & fq (vide Cartesij Meteor Cap 8 sec 1, 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 12, 15) ffor the bow may bee mad by drops of water forcibly cast up into the aire.
54 The spot R (mentioned in Experiment the 52d) grows lesse or lesse by how much the rays fall more & more obliquely on the intermediate filme of aire ef. [which seemes to intimate that the thinness of the intermediate filme of aire (or rather Æther) augments its refraction, untill (when the glasses become contiguous) it bee equall to that of glasse]
55 The surfaces of Glasse doe not reflect soe much light when the glasse is in water as when it is in aire & the lesse any two mediums differ in refraction the lesse their intermediate surface reflects light [which intimates that tis not the superficies of Glasse or any smoth pellucid body that reflects light but rather the cause is the diversity of Æther in Glasse & aire or in any contiguous bodys though the parts of the Glasse must necessarily reflect some rays.
<15>
56 The pouders of Pellucid bodys is white soe is a cluster of small bubles of aire, the scrapings of black or cleare horne, &c: [because of the multitude of reflecting surface soe are bodys which are full of flaws, or those whose parts lye not very close together (as Metalls, Marble, the Oculus Mundi Stone &c) whose pores betwixt their parts admit a grosser Æther into them than the pores in their parts]. hence
57 Most Bodys (viz: those into which water will soake as paper, wood, Marble, the Oculus Mundi Stone, &c) become more darke & transparent by being soaked in water [for the water fills up the reflecting pores]
58 I tooke a bodkin gh & put it betwixt my eye & the bone as neare to the Backside of my eye as I could: & pressing my eye with the end of it (soe as to make the curvature a, bcdef in my eye) there appeared severall white darke & coloured circles r, s, t, &c. Which circles were plainest when I continued to rub my eye with the point of the bodkin, but if I held my eye & the bodkin still, though I continued to presse my eye with it yet the circles would grow faint & often disappeare untill I renewed them by moving my eye or the bodkin.
59 If the experiment were done in a light roome so that though my eyes were shut some light would get through their lidds There appeared a greate broade blewish darke circle outmost (as ts), & within that another light spot srs whose colour was much like that in the rest of the eye as at k. Within which spot appeared still another blew spot r, <16> especially if I pressed my eye hard & with a small pointed bodkin. & outmost at vt appeared a verge of light
60 But on the contrary if I tryed the experiment in very darke roome the circle ts apeared of a Reddish light sr of a darkish blew & the middle spot r appeared lighter againe; & there seemed to be a circle of darke blew tv without the circle ts the outmost of all [I conceive (in the 60th experiment) where the curvature of the Retina at ma & fn began & was but little the blew colour tv was caused; at ab & ef where the Retina was most concave, the bright circle ts was caused: at bc. & de where the Retina was not much incurved nor strained the darke blew circle sr was caused & at cd where the Retina was stretched & made convex the light spot r was caused. In the 59th Experiment the spirits were perhaps strained out of the Retina at ab, ef, & cd or otherways made incapable of being acted upon by light & soe made a lesse appearance of light than the rest of the Retina]
61 That the same circle ts which appeared light in the darke, appeared darke in the light I found by suddenly letting in light into a darke darke roome for then the bright circles would imediatly turne into darke ones & darke ones into bright ones.
62 I could sometimes perceive vivid colours of blew & red, made by the said pressure & perhaps a criticall eye might have discerned this order of colours. in the 60th experiment viz from the center greene, blew, purple, darke purple, blew, greene, yellow, red like flame, yellow, greene, blew, broade purple, darke.
63 Looking on a very light object as the Sun or his image reflected; for a while after there would remaine an impression of colours in my eye: viz: white objects looked red & soe did        all objects in the light but if I went into a dark roome the Phantasma was blew.
64 That vision is made in the retina appeares because colours are made by pressing the bakside of the eye; but when the eye turns towards the pressure, soe that it is pressed before the colours cease.
<17>
The Tunica Retina grows not from the sides of the optick nerv (as the other two which rise one one from the dura, the other from the Pia mater) but it grows from the middle of the nerve sticking to it all over the extremitys of its marrow. Which Marrow if the nerve bee any where cut cross wise twixt the eye & the union of the nerves, appeares full of small spots or pimples, which are a little prominent, especially if the nerve be pressed or warmed at a candle. And these shoot into the very eye & may bee seene with in side where the retina grows to the nerve: and they also continue to the very juncture EFGH. But at this juncture they end on a suddein into a more tender white pap like the interior part of the braine & soe the nerve continues after the juncture into the braine filled with a white tender pap in which can bee seene noe distinction of parts as betwixt the said juncture & the eye. 
Now I conceive that every point in the retina of one eye hath its correspondent point in the other, from which two very slender pipes filled with a most lympid liquor doe without either interuption or any other uneavenesse or irregularity in their processe, goe along the optick nerves to the juncture EFGH where they meete either twixt GF or FH, & there unite into one pipe as big as bothe of them, & so continue in one passing either twixt IL or MK into the braine where they are terminated perhaps at the next meeting of the nerves twixt the Cerebrum & cerebellum, in the same order that their extemities were scituate in the Retinals. And so there are a vast multitud of these slender pipes which flow from the braine the one halfe through the right side nerve IL till they come of the juncture GF where they are each divided into two branches the one passing by G & T to the right side of the right eye AB, the other halfe shooting through the juncture EF & soe passing by X to the right side of the left eye αβ. And in like manner the other halfe shooting through the left side nerve MK divide themselves at FH & their branches passing by EV to the right ey & by HY to the left, compose that  of the Retina <18> in both eyes which is towards the left side, CD, & γδ.
Hence it appears i why the two images of both eyes make but one image abcd in the braine. 2 Why when one eye is distorted objects appear double, ffor if the image of any object bee made upon α in the one ey & β in the other, that object shall have two images in the brain at a & b. Therefore the pictures of any object ought to bee made upon the corresponding points of the two Retinas if upon A in the right ey then upon α in the left. If upon B then also upon β. And soe shall the motions concurr after they have past the juncture GH & make one image at a or b more vivid then one ey alone could doe. 3 Why though one thing may appeare in two places by distorting the eye yet two things cannot appear in one place. If the picture of one thing fall upon A & of another upon α, they may both proceed to p but noe farther, they cannot both be carried on the same pipes pa into the braine, that which is strongest or most helped by fantasy will there prevaile & blot out the other. 4 Why a blew seene by one eye & a yellow by the other at the same time produces a greene unlesse the fantasy make one colour prædominant. 5tly Why if one of the branches of the nerve beyond the juncture as at GF or FH should bee cut: That halfe of both eys toward the wounded nerve would bee blind, the other halfe remaing perfect. 6tly Why the juncture is almost as broad again twixt G & H then twixt E & F, becaus all the tubuli of both eys pass twixt G & H & but  of them twixt E & F. It is not quite so broad again because the tubuli crossing in G are joining &c: also the thicknes of the quicks &c.7tly why the nerve GILF buts not directly upon the nerve XEHY but deviates a little towards TV because its Tubuli are to passe only into that side of the nerve EHYX towards EX. The like of FMKH 8thly why the marrow of the nerve TVEG grows soft on a suddein when it comes at the juncture EF & more suddenly on that side towards G then towards E. And the like of the nerve EXYH. For it being necesary that the nerve TVEG should bee stretcht & bended severall ways by the motion of the eye: Therefore the tubuli are involved or wrought up with in the substances of severall tough skins which being foulded up together compose the marrow of the nerve, pretty sollid & flexible least the tubuli should be prejuced by the severall motions of the nerve. And those small pimples or prominences which appeare in the nerve cut crosse wise I conceive to bee made by the foldings of these crasser skins. But the nerve at the juncture EGFH being well guarded from all violence &c. <19> motion by the bones into which it is closely adapted: tis not necessary the said membranes substance should be continued any further then EG therefore the tubuli there on a suddein unsheath themselves there on the inner side of the nerves towards VE & XE may severally crosse twixt EF & bee united with their correspondents on the other sides YH & TG. Now because the inner tubuli must first crosse before they can convene with the outmost tubuli of the opposite nerve hence it is that the nerves grow soft sooner on the inner side at E then on the outer side at G & H.   9thly why the two nerves meet a second time in the braine, because the two half images caried along IL & MK may bee united into one complete image in the sensory. Note that the nerves at their contact |  meeting are round about disjoyned from the rest of the braine, nor are they soe thick theire as a little before their meeting. But by their externall figure they seeme as if the capillamenta concentered like the radii of a hemisphere to a point in the lower part of the juncture. And tis probable that the visive faculty is there for else why doe the nerves swell there to so great a bulke as it were preparing for their last office, why doe they run directly crosse from either side the braine to meet there if the designe was to have the motions coveyed by the short cut from the eye to the sensorium before they grew too weak. If they were to proceed further , they might have gone a shorter cut & in a lesse channell. There is indeed a marrow shoots from under them toward the cerebellum to which they are united but the greatest part of their substance if not all of it lys above this marr{ow} & also shoots cross beyond it to the center of the brain where they meet. Lastly the substance here is most pure, the scituation in the midst of the brain, constituting the upper part of that small passage twixt all the ventricles. where all superfluous humors have the greatest advantages to slide away that they may not incumber that precious organ
Light seldom striks upon the parts of grosse bodys (as may bee seen in its passing through them), its reflection & refraction is made by the diversity of æthers, & therefore its effect on the Retina can only bee to make this vibrate which motion then must bee either carried in the optick nerve to the sensorium or produce other motions that are carried thither. Not the latter for water is too grosse for such subtile impressions & as for animall spirits <20> though I tyed a peice of the optick nerve at one end & warmed it in the middle to see if any aery substance by that meanes would disclose it selfe in bubbles at the other end, I could not spy the least bubble; a little moisture only & the marrow it selfe squeezed out. And indeed they that know how difficultly aire enters small pores of bodys, have reason to suspect that an aery body though much finer then aire can pervade easily & without violence (as it ought to doe) the small pores of the braine & nerves, I should say of water, because those pores are filled with water, & if it could it would bee too subtil to bee imprissoned by the dura mater & Skull, & might passe for æther. However, what need of such spirits    much Motion is ever lost by communication especially twixt bodys of different constitutions. and therefore it can noe way bee conveyed to the sensorium so entirely as by the æther it selfe Nay granting mee but that ther are pipes filld with a pure transparent liquor passing from the ey to the sensorium & the vibrating motion of the æther will of necessity run along thither. ffor nothing interrupts that motion but reflecting surfaces, & therefore also that motion cannot stray through the reflecting surfaces of the pipe but must rush along (like a sound in a trunk) intire to the sensorium. And that vision bee thus made is very conformable to the sense of hearing which is made by like vibrations.
ffrom the whitenes of the brain & nerves the thicknesse of its vessells may be determined & their cavitys guessed at. And its pretty to consider how these agree with the utmost distinctnesse in vision. As also with the intent of nature in conveying distinctly the motions of the Aether.
<21>
If rays be incident out of glasse upon a film of air terminated twixt two glasses, the thicknesse of a vibration is , or  part of an inch
If water was put twixt the glasses the thickness of a vibration was  inch, of  of its former dimensions. viz as the densitys of the interjected mediums.
If the rays were incident obliquely, the circles increase so that their diameters are as the secants of the rays obliquity within the film of air, or reciprocally as their celerity within the said film.
And the thicknesse belonging to each vibration is as the squares of those secants of celeritys, And the lengths of the rays belonging to each vibration as their cubes.
The first pulse ends at the first dark circle
The thicknesse of a pulse of extream rubiform rays to that of purpuriform ones perpendicularly incident is greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 5 to 3. viz as 9 to 14 or 13 to 20. And the thicknesse belonging to each coulour is 13, 14 14, 15 16. 17. 18. 19. for extreame purple, intense purple, Indico, blew, green, the terminus of green & yellow, yellow, orange, red, extream red.

The Lawes of Motion
<81r>
The Lawes of Motion  How solitary bodyes are moved.
Sect: 1[1]. There is an uniform extension, space, or expansion continued every way without bounds: in which all bodyes are, each in severall parts of it: which parts of space possesse {illeg} adequately filled by them are their places. And their passing out of one place or part of space into another, through all the intermediate space is their motion. Which motion is done with more or lesse velocity accordingly as tis done through more or lesse space in equal times or through equall spaces in more or lesse time. But the motion it selfe & the force to persevere in that motion is more or lesse accordingly as the factus of the bodys bulk into its velocity is more or lesse. And that force is equivalent to that motion which it is able to beget or destroy.
2[2]. The motion of a body tends one way  directly & severall other ways obliqly. As if the body A move directly towards the point B it also moves obliquely towards all the lines BC, BD, BE & which passe through that point B: & shall arrive to them all at the same time. Whence its velocity towards them is in such proportion as its distance from them that is, as AB, AC, AD, AE &c.
3[3]. If a body A move towards B with  the velocity R, & by the way hath some new force done to it which had the body rested would have propel{e}d it towards C with the velocity S. Then making AB∶AC∷R∶S, & Completing the Parallelogram BC the body shall move in the Diagonall AD & arrive at the point D with this compound motion in the same time it would have arrived at the point B with its single motion.
4[4] In every body there is a certaine point, called its center of motion about which if the body bee any way circulated the endeavours of its parts every way from the center are exactly counterpoised by opposite endeavours. And the progressive motion of the body is the same with the motion of this its center which always moves in a streight line & uniformly when the body is free from occursions with other bodys. And so doth the common center of two bodys; which is <81v> found by dividing the distance twixt their propper centers in reciprocall proportion to their bulk. And so the common center of 3 or more bodys &c. And all the lines passing through these centers of motion are axes of motion.
5[5]. The angular quantity of a bodys circular  motion & velocity is more or lesse accordingly as the body makes one revolution in more {or} lesse time but the reall quantity of its circular motion is more or lesse accordingly as the body hath more or lesse power & force to persevere in that motion; which motion divided by the bodys bulke is the reall quantity of its circular velocity. Now to know the reall quantity of a bodys circular motion & velocity about any given axis EF; Suppose it hung upon the two end E & F of that axis as upon two poles: And that another globular body of the same bignesse, whose center is A, is so placed that the circulating body shall hit it in the point F & strike it away in the line BAG (which lyeth in the same plane with one of the circles described about the axis EF) & thereby just loose all its owne motion. Then hath the Globe gotten the same quantity of progressive motion & velocity which the other had of circular, its velocity being the same with that of the point C which describes a circle touching the line BG. The Radius DC of which circle I may therefore call the radius of Circular motion or velocity about that axis EF. And the circle described with the said Radius of Circulation in that plane which cuts the axis EF perpendicularly in the center of motion I call the Equator of circulation about that axis, and those circles which passe through the poles, meridians &c.
6[6]. A body circulates about one axis (as PC)  directly & about severall other axes (as AC, BC, &c) obliquely. And the angular quantity of its circulations about those axes (PC, AC, BC &c) are as the sines (PC, AD, BE, &c) of the angles which those axes make with the Equator (FG) of the principall & direct axis (PC).
<82r>
7[7]. If a body circulates about the axis AC with  the angular quantity of velocity R: & some new force is done to it, which, if the body had rested, would have made it circulate about another axis BC, with the angular quantity of velocity S. Then in the plane of the two axes, & in one of those two opposite angles (made by the axes) in which the two circulations are contrary one to another, (as in the angle ACB). I find such a point P from which the perpendic{la}rs (PK, PH) let fall to those axes bee reciprocally proportional to the angular velocitys about those axes, (that is PK∶PH∷R∶S). And drawing the line PC, it shall bee the new axis about which the compound motion is performed. And the summe of  &  when the perpendiculars PH & PK fall on divers sides of the axis PC, otherwise their difference, is the angular quantity of circulation about that axis: Which in the angle  tends contrary to the circulation about the axis 
8[8]. Every body keepes the same reall quantity of circular motion & velocity so long as tis not opposed by other bodys. And it keeps the same axis too if the endeavour from the axis which the two opposite quarters twixt the Equator & every meridian of motion have, bee exactly counterpoised by the opposite endeavours of the 2 side quarters; & then also its axis doth always keepe parallel to it selfe. But if the said endeavours from the axis bee not exactly counterpoised by such opposite endeavours: then for want of such counterpoise the prevalent parts shall by little & little get further from the axis & draw nearer & nearer to such a Counterpoise, but shall never bee exactly counterpoised. And as the axis is continually moved in the body, so it continually moves in the space too with some kind or other of spirall motion; always drawing nearer & nearer to a center or parallelisme with it selfe, but never attaining to it. Nay tis so far from ever keeping parallel to it selfe, that it shall never bee twice in the same position.
How Bodys are Reflected.
9[9]. Suppose the bodys A & α did move in  the lines DA & Eα till they met in the point B: that BC is the plane which toucheth them in the point of contact B: that the velocity of the <82v> Body A towards the said plane of contact is B, & the motion AB; & that the change which is made by reflection in that velocity & motion is X & AX. Suppose also that from the body A its center of motion two lines are drawne the one AB to the point of contact the other AC to the plane of Contact: that the intercepted line BC is F: that the axis of motion which is perpendicular to the plane ABC & its Equator are called the axis & Equator of reflected circulation: that the radius of that Equator is G: that the reall quantity of velocity about that axis is D, & the AD: that the change which reflection {m}akes in that velocity & motion is y & AY: And that the correspondent lines & motions of the other body α are β, αβ, ξ, αξ, φ, γ, δ, αδ, ν & αν. Lastly for brevity sake suppose that . And . Observing that at the time of reflection if in either body the center of motion doth move from the plane of contact, or those parts of it nearest the point of contact doe circulate from the plane of contact: then the said motion is to bee esteemed negative & the signe of its velocity B, β, D or δ must bee made negative in the valor of Q.
10[10]. The velocitys B, β, D & δ & they only are directly opposed & changed in Reflection; & that according to these rules . . . & . Which mutations X ξ Y & ν tend all of them from the plane of Contact. And these four rules I gather thus: The whole velocity of the two points of contact towards one another perpendicularly to the plane of contact is Q (arising partly from the bodys progressive velocity B & β & partly from their circular D & δ): And the same points are reflected one from another with the same quantity of such velocity. So that the whole change of all that their velocity which is perpendicular to the plane of contact is Q. Which change must bee distributed amongst the foure opposed velocitys B, β D & δ proportionably to the easinesse (or smallnesse of resistance) with which those velocitys are changed, that is, proportionably to , , , & . Soe that . that is . . . & .
11[11]. Now if any two reflecting bodys A & α, with the quantity <83r> of their progressive & angular motions; & their position at their meeting & consequently their point & plane of contact &: be given: to know how those bodys shall bee reflected, First find B & β by sec 2. Then the lines F & φ & the axis of reflected circulation by sec 9. & their Radij G & γ by sec 5. Then their angular quantity of velocity about the axes of reflected circulation by sec 6, & the reall quantity D & δ by sec 5. Then P & Q by sec 9 Then X, ξ, Y & ν by sec 10. Then the bodys new progressive determinations & velocitys by sec 3. Then the angular quantity of that circulation (Y & ν) which is generated by reflection by sec 5. And lastly the new axes & angular quantity of velocity about them by sec 7.
Some Observations about Motion.
Only those bodyes which are absolutely hard are exactly reflected acording to those rules. Now the bodyes here amongst us (being an aggregate of smaller other bodyes) haue a relenting softnesse & springynesse, which makes their contact be for some time & in more points then one. And the touching surfaces during the time of contact doe slide one upon another more or lesse or not at all acording to their roughnesse. And few or none of these bodyes haue a springynesse soe strong, as to force them one from another with the same vigor that they came together. Besides that their motions are continually impeded & slackened by the mediums in which they move. Now hee that would prescribe rules for the reflections of these compound bodies, must consider in how many points the two bodies touch at their meeting, the position & pression of every point, which their planes of contact &c: & how all these are varyed every moment during the time of contact by the more or lesse relenting softnesse or springynesse of those bodies & their various slidings. And also what effect the air or other mediums compressed betwixt the bodies may haue.
2 These are some cases of Reflections of bodies absolutely hard to which these rules extend not: As when two bodies meet with their angular point, or in more points <83v> then one at once; Or with their superficies. But these cases are rare.
3 In all reflections of any bodies what ever this rule is true that the common center of two or more bodies changeth not its state of motion or rest by the reflection of those bodies one amongst another.
4 Motion may be lost by reflection. As  if two equall Globes A & α with equall motions from D & δ done in the perpendicular lines DA & δα, hit one another when the center of the body α is in the line DA. Then the body A shall loose all its motion & yet the motion of α is not doubled. For completing the square Bβ, the body α shall move in the Diagonall αC, & arrive at C but at the same time it would haue arrived at β without reflection. see the third section.
5 Motion may be gained by reflection. For if the body α return with the same motion back again from C to α. The two bodyes A & α after reflection shall regain the same equall motions in the lines AD & αδ (though backwards) which they had at first.

The October 1666 Tract on Fluxions
<48v>
 Note that if there happen to bee in any equation either a fraction or surde quantity or a Mechanichall one, (i:e: which cannot bee Geometrically computed, but is expressed by the area or length or gravity or content of some curve line or sollid, &c) To find in what proportion the unknowne quantitys increase or decrease doe thus. 1 Take two letters the one (as ξ) to signify that quantity, the other (as π) its motion of increase or decrease: And making an equation betwixt the letter (ξ) & the quantity signifyed by it, find thereby (by prop 7 if the quantity bee Geometricall, or by some other meanes if it bee mechanicall) the valor of the other letter (π). 2 Then substituting the letter (ξ) signifying that quantity, into its place in the maine Equation esteeme that letter (ξ) as an unknowne quantity & performe the worke of seaventh proposition; & into the resulting Equation instead of those letters ξ & π substitute theire valors. And soe you have the Equation required.
Example 1. To find p & q the motions of x & y whose relation is, . first suppose , Or . & thereby find π the motion of ξ, viz: (by prop 7) . Or . Secondly in the Equation , writing ξ in stead of , the result is , whereby find the relation of the motions p, q, & π: viz (by prop 7)  . In which Equation instead of ξ & π writing theire valors, the result is, . which was required to.
[which equation multiplyed by , is . & in stead of , writing its valor , it is . Or . Which conclusion will also bee found by taking the surde quantity out the given Equation for both parts being squared it is . & therefore (by prop 7) , as before.]
 Note also that it may bee more convenient (setting all the termes on one side of the Equation) to put every fractionall, irrationall & mechanicall terme, as also the summe of the rationall termes, equall severally to some letter: & then to find the motions corresponding to each of those letters the sume of which motions is the Equation required.
Example the 2d. If  is the relation twixt x & y, whose motions p & q are required. I make ; ; & . & the motions of τ, φ, & ξ being called β, γ, & δ; the first Equation , gives (by prop 7) . the second , gives ; Or . & the Third , gives, ; Or . Lastly , is the Equation sought.
Example 3d. If . be=y. & the superficies abc=z  suppose that , is the relation twixt x, y & z, whose motions are p, q, & r: & that p & q are desired. The Equation  gives (by prop 7), . Now drawing dh∥ab⊥ad=1−bh. I consider the superficies abhd=ab×bh=x×1=x, & abd=z doe increase in the proportion of bh to bc: yt is, 1∶ ∷p∶r. Or . Which valor of r being substituted into the Equation , gives . which was required.
How to proceede in other cases (as when there are cube rootes, surde denominators, rootes within rootes (as  &c: in the equation) may bee easily deduced from what {ha}th bee{n} already said.

To resolve Problems by Motion these following Propositions are sufficient
1 If the body a in the Perimeter of the cirkle or sphære adc  moveth towards its center b, its velocity to each point ( d, c, e,) of that circumference is as the chords (ad, ac, ae) drawne from that body to those points are.
2 If the △s adc, aec, are alike viz ad = ec &c (though in divers plaines) & 3 bodys  move from the point a uniformely & in equall times the first to d, the 2d to e, the 3d to c; Then is the thirds motion compounded of the motion of the first & second.
3. All the points of a Body keeping Parallel to it selfe are in equall velocity.
4. If a body move onely circularly | angularly about some axis, the velocity of its points are as their distance from that axis.
5. The motions of all bodys are either parallel or angular, or mixed of them both, after the same manner that the motion towards c (Prop 2) is compounded of those towards d & e. And in mixed motion any line may bee taken for the axis (or if a line or superficies move in plano, any point in that plane may bee taken for the center) of the angular motion
6 If the lines ae, ah being moved doe continually intersect; I describe  the trapezium abcd, & its diagonall ac: & say that, the proportion & position of these five lines ab, ad, ac, cb, cd, being determined by requisite data; shall designe the proportion & position of these five motions; viz: of the point a fixed in the line ae & moveing towards b, of the point a fixed in the line ah & moveing towards d; of the intersection point a moveing in the plaine abcd towards c, (for those five lines are ever in the same plaine, though ae & ah may chanch onely to touch that plaine in their intersection point a); of the intersection point a moveing in the line ae parallely to cb & according to the order of the letters c, b; & of the intersection point a move{ing} in the line ah parallely to cd & according to the order of the {lett}ers c, d.
Note that one of the lines as ah (fig 3d & 4th) resting, the points d & a are coincident, & the point c shall bee in the line ah if it bee streight (fig 3), otherwise in its tangent (fig 4th)
7. Haveing an equation expressing the relation twixt two or  more lines x, y, z &c: described in the same time by two or more moveing bodys A, B, C, &c. the relation of their velocitys p, q, r, &c may bee thus found, viz: Set all the termes on one side of the Equation that they become equall to nothing. And first multiply each terme by so many times  as x hath dimensions in that terme. Secondly multiply each terme by so many times  as y hath dimensions in it. Thirdly (if there be 3 unknowne quantitys) multiply each terme by so many times  as z hath dimensions in that terme. (& if there bee still more unknowne quantitys doe like to every unknowne quantity). The summe of all these products shall bee equall to nothing. which Equation gives the relation of the velocitys p, q, r, &c Or thus. Translate all the termes to one side of the equation, & multiply them being ordered according to x by this progression, {illeg}  &c. or being ordered by the dimensions of y multiply them by this,:  &c. The sume of these products shall bee equall to nothing, which equation gives the relation of their velocitys p, q, &c.
<49v>
Or more Generally the Equation may bee multiplyed by the terme of these progressions  &c. And  &c. (a & b signifying any two numbers whither rationall or irrationall
8. If two Bodys A & B, by their velocitys p & q describe the lines x & y. & an Equation bee given expressing the relation twixt one of the lines x, & y ratio  of their motions q & p; To find the other line y.
Could this bee ever done all problems whatever might bee resolved. But by the following rules it may bee very often done. (Note that ±m & ±n are logarithmes or numbers signifying the dimensions of x.)
ffirst get that valor of . Which if it bee rationall & its Denominator consist of but one terme: Multiply that valor by x & divide each terme of it by the logarithme of x in that terme the quote shall bee the valor of y. As if  . Then is . Or if . Then is . (Soe if . Then is . soe that y is infinite. But note that in this case x & y increase in the same proportion that numbers & their logarithmes doe, y being like a logarithme added to an infinite number . But if x bee diminished by c, as if =, y is also diminished by the infinite number  & becomes finite like a logarithme of the number x. & so x being given, y may bee mechanichally found by a Table of logarithmes, as shall bee hereafter showne.)
Secondly. But if the denominator of the valor of  consist of more termes than one, it may bee reduced to such a forme that the denominator of each parte of it shall have but one terme, unlesse that parte bee : Soe that y may bee then found by the precedent rule. Which reduction is thus performed, viz: 1st, If the denominator bee not a+bx, nor all its termes multiplyed by x or xx, or x3, &c; Increase or diminish x untill the last terme of the Denominator vanish. 2dly, And when all the termes in the Denominator are multiplyed by x, xx, or x3 &c: Divide the numerator by the Denominator (as in Decimall numbers) untill the Quotient consist of such parts none of whose Denominators are so multiplyed by x, x2 & begin the Division in those termes in which x is of its fewest dimensions unlesse the Denominator be a+bx . If then the termes in the valor of  bee such as was before required the valor of y may bee found by the first parte of this Prop: onely it must bee so much diminished or increased as it was before increased or diminished by increasing or diminishing x. But if the denominator of any terme consist of more termes than one, unlesse that terme bee  . First find those parts of y's valor which correspond to the other parts of  its valor. & then by the preceding reductions &c: seeke the parte of y's valor answering to this parte of  its valor.
Example 1st. If . Then by Division tis . (as may appeare by multiplication.) Therefore (by 1st parte of this Prop:) tis . ( signifys that parte of the valor of y which is correspondent to the terme  of the valor of , which may bee found by a Table of logarithmes as may hereafter appeare.)
<50r> 
Example 2d. If . I suppose x=z−a. Or . And by Division , (as may appeare by multiplication.) And substituteing x+a into the place of z, tis  . And Therefore (by parte 1st of Prop 8) .
But sometimes The last terme of the Denominator cannot bee taken away, (as if the Denominator bee aa+xx. or a4+x4 or a4+bbxx+x4 &c) And then it will bee necessary to have in readinesse some examples with such Denominators to which all other cases of like denomination may bee by Division reduced. As if  . Make bxx=z, Then is .
. Make bx3=z, Then is .
. Make bx4=z, Then is . &c. In Generall if . Make bxn=z, & then is . Also if . Make  & then is . That is, if ; I make x=zz, & . Or if . Make ,  & □=CDV=y 
Thirdly If the valor of  is irrationall being a square roote, The simplest cases may bee reduced to these following examples.
1. If . Then .
2. If . Then 
3. If . Then .
4. If . Then .

But all those areas (& consequently □, □, □) may bee Mechanichally found either by a Table of logarithmes or signes & Tangents. And I have beene therefore hitherto content to suppose them knowne, as the basis of most of the precedent propositions.
Note also that if the C Valor of  consists of severall parts each part must bee considered severally, as if:  . Then is □ . & □ . Therefore □.
Note also that of the denominator of the valor of  consist of both rationall & surde quantitys or of two or more surde quantitys First take those surde quantitys out of the denominator, & then seeke (y) by the precedent theoremes

Example 1. If  . Then by division is  &c. And consequently  &c.

But the Demonstrations of hath beene said must not bee wholly omitted.
Prop 7 Demonstrated.  
Lemma. If two bodys A, B, move uniformely the oneother from ab to c, d, e, f,g, h, k, l, &c: in the same time. Then are the lines ac,bg, & cd,gh, & de,hk, & ef,kl, &c: as their velocitys p.q. And though they move not uniformely yet are the infinitely little lines which each moment they describe, as their velocitys which they have while they describe them. As if the body A with the velocity p describe the infinitely little line (cd=)p×o in one moment, in that moment the body B with the velocity q, will describe the line (gh=)q×o. For p:q::po:qo. Soe that if the described lines bee (ac=)x, & (bg=)y, in one moment, they will bee (ad=)x+po, & (bh=)y+qo in the next.
Demonstr: Now if the equation expressing the relation twixt the lines x & y bee x3−abx+a3−dyy=0. I may substitute x+po & y+qo into the place of x & y; because (by the lemma) they as well as x & y, doe signify the lines described by the bodys A & B. By doeing so there results x3+3poxx+3ppoox+p3o3−dyy−2dqoy−dqqoo=0−abx−abpo+a3. But x3−abx+a3−dyy=0 (by supp). Therefore there remaines onely 3poxx+3ppoox+p3o3−abpo−2dqoy−dqqoo=0. Or dividing it by o tis 3px2+3ppox+p3oo−abp−2dqy−dqqo=0. Also those termes are infinitely little in which o is . Therefore omitting them there rests 3pxx−abp−2dqy=0. The like may bee done in all other equations.
Hence I observe. First that those termes ever vanish which are not multiplyed by o, they being the propounded equation. Secondly those termes also vanish in which o is of more than one dimension, because they are infinitely lesse than those in which o is but of one dimension. Thirdly the still remaining termes, being divided by o will have that forme which, by the 1st rule in Prop 7th, they should have (as may partly appeare by the second termes of Mr Oughtreds latter Analiticall table).
After the sàme manner may this 7th Prop: bee demonstrated: there being 3 or more unknowne quantitys (x, y, z, &c
Prop 8th is the Converse of this 7th Prop. & may bee therefore Analytically demonstrated by it.
Prop 1st Demonstrated. If some body A move in the right line  gafc from g towards c. From any point d draw df⊥ac. & call, df=a. fg=x, dg=y. Then is aa+xx−yy=0. Now by Prop 7th, may the proportion of (p) the velocity of that body towards f; to (q) its velocity towards d bee found viz 2xp−2yq=0. Or x∶y∷q∶p. That is gf∶gd∷ its velocity to d: its velocity towards f or c. & when the body A is at a, that is when the points g & a are coincident then is ac∶ad∷ad∶af∷ velocity to c∶ velocity to d.
Prop 2d, Demonstrated.     From the points d & e draw df⊥ac⊥ge.  And let the firsts bodys velocity to d bee called ad, the seconds to e bee ae, & the 3ds toward c bee ac. Then shall the firsts velocity towards c bee af (by Prop 1): & The seconds towards c is ag, (prop 1). but af=gc (for △adc=△aec, & △adf =△gec. by sup). Therefore ac=ag+gc =ag+af. That is the velocity of the third body towards c is equall to the summ of the velocitys of the first & second body towards c.
<53v>
The former Theorems Applyed to Resolving of Problems.
Prob. 1. To draw Tangents to crooked lines.
Seeke (by prop 7th; or 3d, 4th & 2d, &c) the motions of those streight lines to which the crooked line is cheifely referred, & with what velocity they increase or decrease: & they shall give (by prop 6t, or 1st or 2d) the motion of the point describing the crooked line; which motion is in its tangent.
Tangents to Geometricall lines.
Example 1. If the crooked line fac is described by the  intersection of two lines cb & dc the one moveing parallely, viz: cb∥ad, & dc∥ab; soe that if ab=x, & bc=y=ad, Their relation is x4−3y+10ax3+ayxx−2y3x+a4−y4=0. To draw the tangent hcr; I consider that the point c fixed in the line cb moves towards e parallely to ab (for so doth the line cb (by supp:) & consequently all its points): also the point c fixed in the line dc moves towards g parallely to ad (by sup): therefore I draw ce∥ab & cg∥ad, & in such proportion as the motions they designe & so draw er∥cb, & gr∥dc, & the diagonall cr, (by Prop 6), that is, if the velocity of the line cb, (that is the celerity of the increasing of ab, or dc; or the velocity of the point c from d) bee called p, & the velocity of the line cd bee called q; I make ce∶gc∷p∶q(∷ce∶er∷hb∶cb.) & the point c shall move in the diagonall line cr (by prop 6) which is therefore the required tangent Now the relation of p & q may bee found by the foregoing Equation (p signifying the increase of x, & q of y) to bee 4px3−9pyxx+30paxx+2payx−2py3−3qx3+qaxx−6qyyx−4qy3=0. by Prop 7 And therefore . which determines the tangent hc
 Hence may bee observed this Generall Theorem for Drawing Tangents to crooked lines thus referred to streight ones; that is, to such lines in which y=bc is ordinately applyed to x=ab at any given angle abc. viz: Multiply the termes of the Equation ordered according to the dimensions of y, by any Arithmeticall progression which product shall bee the Numerator: Againe change the signes of the Equation & ordering it according to x, multiply the termes by any Arithmeticall progression & the product divided by x shall bee the Denominator of the valor of hb, that is, of x produced from y to the tangent hc.
As if  . 2.1.0.Then firstyy∗=0−rx0.-1.-2., produceth 2yy, or, 2rx−2xx. Secondly 2.1.0.Secondly+rx−yy produceth  . Therefore  . Or else  .
Example 2. If the crooked line chm bee describe by  the intersection of two lines ac, bc circulating about their centers a & b, soe that if ac=x, & bc=y; their relation is x3−abx+cyy=0. To draw the tangent ec I consider that the point c fixed in the line bc moves towards f in the line cf⊥bc (for the tangent to a circle is perpendicular to its radius). also the point c fixed in the line ac moves towards d in the line cd⊥ac & from those lines cd & cf I draw two others de∥cg & ef∥bc which must bee in such proportion one to another as the motions represented by them (prop 6), that is (prop 6) as the <54r> motions of the intersection point c moveing in the lines ca & cb  to or from the centers a & b; that is, (the celerity of the increase of x being called p, & of y being q), de∶ef∷p∶q. Then shall the diagonall ce bee the required tangent.

Now the relation of p & q may bee found by the given Equation to bee, 3pxx−pab+2qcy=0 (by prop 7) Or 2cy∶ab−3xx∷p∶q∷cg∶cn, whichdetermins the tangent ce.
But note that if p, or q be negative cg or cn must bee drawn from c towards a or b, but from a or b if affirmative.
Hence tis easy to pronounce a Theorem for Tangents in such like cases & the like may bee done in all other cases however Geometricall lines bee referred to streight ones.
Tangents to Mechanichall lines
Example the 3d. If the Quadratrix kbf is described by the  intersection (b) of the two lines hb & ap, the one hp∥ma moving uniformly from k to a, whilest the other ap circulates from k to m about the center a. Draw the circle gbl with the Rad. ab; & make bl=bd⊥ab∥de; & to the intersection point e of the lines am & ed draw eb which shall touch the Quadratrix in b. For suppose the motion of the point p fixed in the line ap, towards m to bee pm, then the motion of the point b fixed in the line ab, towards d is bl=bd, (prop 4), & the motion of the line bh towards ca, & therefore of the point b fixed in it towards c (prop 3) is ha=bc (by supp): Also ce∥bh & ed∥ap (sup). Therefore (by Prop 6) is the intersection point b of those two lines ap & hb, moves in the diagonall eb, & consequently eb toucheth the Quadratrix in b.

Prob 2d. To find the quantity of crookednesse of lines.
Lemma. The crookednesse of equall parts of circles are as their diameters reciprocally. For the crookednesse of a whole circle (acdea, bfghmb) amounts to 4 right angles. Therefore there is not more crookednesse in one whole circle acdea than in another  bfghmb. Suppose the perimeter acde=bfgh. Then tis, ar∶br∷ bfgh=acde∶bfghmb∷ crookednesse of bfgh∶crookednesse of bfghmb=crookednesse of acdea.
Resolution. Find That point fixed in the crooked line's perpendicular which is then in least motion, for it is the center of a circle which passing through the given point is of equall crookednesse with the line at that given point. Now, since the crooked line's tangent & perpendicular &c: (at that moment) circulate about that center; I observe, 1st that every point fixed in the Tangent or Perpendicular, or whose position to them is determined, doth describe a curve line to which the right line drawne from that center is perpendicular, & is also the radius of a circle of equall crookedness with it: 2dly that the motion of every such point is as its distance from that center; & so are the motions of the intersection point, in which any radius drawn from that center intersects two parallel lines.
Example 1. If cb=y is ordinately applyed to ab=x  at a right angle abc, nc being tangent & mc perpendicular to the curve line ac: I seeke the motion of two points c & d fixed in the perpendicular cd; or (which is better & to the same purpose) I draw cg∥ab, & seeke the motions of the two intersection points c & d in which the perpendicular cd intersects those fixed lines cfg, & abdk: & then draw cg & dk in such proportion as those motions are, & the line gkm drawn by their ends shall intersect the perpendicular cd in the required center m: mc being the radius of a circle of equall crookednesse with the curve line ac at the point c. Now, Making △cegfe= & like △ncdbc, suppose the motion of the line cb & consequently of the points c & b fixed in it & moveing towards f & k, to bee p=nb=cf: Then is ce=cn the motion of the point c in which bc intersects the tangent ne (by Prop 6), that is of the point c fixed in the perpendicular cd, & moveing in the tangent ne: & therefore cg=nd=p+bd(=p+v if bd=v), is the motion of the intersection point c towards g in which point the perp: cd intersects cg (by Prop 6). If also the motion of the intersection point d from the point b (that is the velocity of the increase of v) bee called r, then is dk=nb+r=p+r soe that, cg−dk∶cd∷cg∶cm; that is, . Also . Lastly the motion of the point c from b, (that is the velocity with which y=cb increaseth) will bee q=cb=y.
As if the nature of the crooked line bee x3−axy+ayy=0. Then is  (by examp: 1. Prob: 1.), &  (for nb∶bc∷bc∶bd) Soe that 3xxy−ayy−axv+2ayv=0. & therefore (by Prop 7) 6pxy−pav−2qay+3qxx+2qav−rax+2ray=0 <55r> & substituting , & , & y, into the places of p, v, & q in this equation The product will bee . Or . And therefore . Also . Soe that . That is . Which Equation gives the point k & consequently the point m. for km∥abk.
 But in such cases where y is ordinately applyed to x at right angles, From the consideration of the Equation  ; Or rather  : may the following Theoreme bee pronounced. To which purpose let X signify the given Equation, that is, all the algebraicall termes (expressing the nature of the given line) considered as equall to nothing & not some of them to others. Let X· signify those termes ordered according to the dimensions of x & then multiplyed by any arithmeticall progression Let X· signify those termes ordered according to the dimensions of y & then multiplyed by any Arithmeticall progression. Let :X signify those termes ordered by x & then multiplyed by any two arithmeticall progressions one of them being greater than the other by a terme. Let X: signify those termes ordered by y & then multiplied by any two Arith: Progr: differing by a terme. Let ·X· signify those termes ordered according to x, & then multiplyed by the greater of the progressions which multiplyed :X; & then ordered by y & multiplyed by the greater progression which multiplyed X:.

Prob 3d. To find the points distinguishing twixt the concave & convex  portions of crooked lines.
Resolution. The lines are not crooked at those points: & therefore the radius cm determining the crookednesse at that point must bee infinitely greate. To which purpose I put the denominator of its valor (in rule the 3d) to bee equall to nothing, & so have this Theoreme ·X·XX:−2·XX··X·+X·X·:X=0. Or better perhaps  .

Probl: 4. To find the points at which lines are most or least crooked.
Resol: At those points the afforesaid radius cm neither increaseth nor decreaseth. So that the center m in that moment doth absolutely rest, & therefore neither the line bk nor al doth increase or diminish, that is, ck & bl doe soe much increase or diminish as y & x (lb & ab) doe diminish or increase. Or in a word the point m resteth. Find therefore the motion of al or cm or lm & suppose it nothing.
Thus to find the point of least crookednesse in the curve x3=ccy By the rule in prob 2 I make ·X=3x3. X·=−ccy. :X=6x3. X:=0 & ·X·equals;0 & thence obteine , or  which is least when  or . And then therefore happens the greatest crookednesse
In like manner if the curve be xxy=a3 The rule gives ·X=2a3 X·=a3 :X=−6a3 X:;=0=·X· And thence  which is least when .
Soe if the curve bee x3=byy. Then is ·X=3x3. X·=−2byy. :X=6x3 X:=−2yyc. ·X·=0. And therefore ck=3y+ , which hath no least nor the curve any least crookednesse.

Prob 5t. To find the nature of the crooked line whose area is expressed by any given equation.
That is, the nature of the area being given to find the nature of the crooked line whose area it is.
Resol. If the relation of ab=x, & abc=y bee given &  the relation of ab=x, & bc=q bee required (bc being ordinately applyed at right angles to ab). Make de∥ab⊥ad∥be=1. & then is □abed=x. Now supposing the line cbe by parallel motion from ad to describe the two superficies ae=x, & abc=y; The velocity with which they increase will bee, as be to bc: that is, the motion by which x increaseth being be=p=1, the motion by which y increaseth will bee bc=q. which therefore may bee found by prop: 7th. viz:  .
Example 1. If  . Or −4rx3+9yy=0. Then is  . Or rx=qq & therefore abc is the Parabola whose area abc is  .
Example 2d. If x3−ay+xy=0. Then is  . Or  
Example 3d. If  . Then is  . Or if axm=bxn; then is  .
Note that by this probleme may bee gathered a Catalogue of all those lines which can bee squared. And therefore it will not bee necessary to shew how this Probleme may bee resolved in other cases in which q is not ordinately applye{d} to x at right angles.
Prob 6. The nature of any Crooked line being given, to find other lines whose areas may bee compared to the area of that given line.
Resol: Suppose the given line to be ac & its area abc=s,  the sought line df & its area def=t; & that bc=z is ordinately applyed to ab=x, & ef=v to de=y, soe that abc=def; & that the velocitys with which ab & de increase (that is, the velocity of the points b & e, or of the lines bc & ef moving from a & d) bee called p & q. Then may the ordinately applyed lines bc & ef multiplyed by their velocitys p & q, (that is pz & qv) signify the velocitys with which the areas abc=s & def=t increase. Now the relation of the areas s & t (taken at pleasure) gives the relation of the motions pz & qv describing those areas, by Proposition the 7th.; Also the relation of the lines ab=x & de=y (taken at pleasure) gives the relation of p & q, by Prop 7th: which two equations, together with the given Equation expressing the nature of the line ac, give the relation of de=y & ef=v that is the desired nature of the line df.
Example 1. As if ax+bxx=zz is the nature of the line ac: & at pleasure I assume s=t to be the relation of the areas abc & def; & x=yy to bee the relation of the lines ab & de. Then is pz=qv (prop 7), & p=2qy (by prop 7). Therefore 2yz=v (by the 2 last Equations), &  =zz=ax+bxx=ayy+by4. or vv=4ay4+4by6. &  : Which is the nature of the line def whose area def is equall to the area abc, supposing  .
<57v>
Example 2. If ax+bxx=zz as before; & I assume, as+bx=t, & x=yy. Then is apz+bp=qv (by prop 7), & p=2qy. 2azy+2by=v=2by+2ay . Or v=2by+2ayy ; The required nature of the line def.
Example 3d. If  : & at pleasure I assume  , & xx−a=y. Then is 4ccay+ccyy=aass+2aast+aatt, And (by prop 7) 4ccaq+8ccyq=2aaspz+2aatpz+2aasqv+2aatqv= . & (by prop 7) 2px=q. Therefore  . But  . &  , Therefore  . That is ca+2cy=2cy+ . Or  .
Example 4th. If ax+bxx=zz as before & I assume ss=t, & x=yy. Then is 2spz=qv, & p=2qy (by prop 7) Therefore  . Where note that in this case the line  is a Mechanicall one because s the area of the line ax+bxx=zz canott bee Geometrically found. The like is to bee observed in other such like cases.
Probl: 7. The Nature of any Crooked line being given to find its area when it may bee. Or more generally, two crooked lines being given to find the relation of their areas, when it may bee.
Resolution. In the figure of the fift probleme Let abc=y represent the area of the given line acf; cb=q the motion describing that area; abed=x another area which is equall to the basis ab=x of that given line acf, (viz: supposing ab∥de⊥be∥ad=1); & be=p=1 the motion describing that other area. Now haveing (by supp) the relation twixt ab=x=abed, & bc=q= given, I seeke the area abc=y by the Eight proposition
Example 1. If the nature of the line bee,  . I looke in the tables of the Eight proposition for the Equation corresponding to this Equati{on} which I find to bee  , (For if instead of c, a, b, n I write a, aa, −1, 2, it will be  .) And against it is the equation . And substituting a, aa, −1, 2 into the places of c, a, b, n it will bee,  the required area.
Example 2. If  . Because there are two termes in the valor of bc I consider them severally & first I find the area correspondent to the terme  , or  ; To bee  , or  , by prop: 8. part 1. Secondly to find the area corresponding to the other terme  I looke the Equation (in prop 8. part 3) corresponding to it which is , (for if instead of c, a, b, n, I write eeb, −1, a, −1, it will bee  , Or  ): Against which is the Equation  . <58r> In which writing eeb, −1, a, −1, instead of c, a, b, n, the result will bee  ; Or,  which is the  area corresponding to that other terme. Now to see how these areas stand related one to another I draw the annexed scheme, in which is ab=x.  .  . &  . Soe that  is the superficies corresponding to the first terme bd, which because it is affirmative must bee extended (or lye) from the line bd towards a. Also the other superficies correspondent to the 2d terme de, being negative must lye on the other side bd from a, which is therefore  . Lastly if x=ab=r Then is  . &  . And if aB=x=s, then is  , And  . Soe that,  . &  & substracting DdeE from bBDd there remaines  . which is the required Area of the given line &cfkeEg. Where note that for the quantitys r=ab & s=aB taking any numbers you may thereby finde the area bBdD correspond to their difference bB.
Note that sometimes one parte of the Area may bee Affirmative & the other negative. as if a2B=r, & ab=s. Then is b2B2Ee=kbe−k2B2E= =b2B2Ee=kbe−k2B2E.

Prob 9. To find such crooked lines whose lengths may bee found &also to find theire lengths.
Lemma 1. If to any crooked immovable line acg  the streight line dcmσ moves to & fro perpendicularly every point of the said line cdmσ (as γ, θ, σ, &c) shall describe a curve line (as βγ, δθ, λσ, &c) all which will bee perpendicular to the said line cdmσ, & also parallel one to another & to the line acg.
2. If acg bee not a circle, there may bee drawne some curve line βδmλ, which the moving line cdmδ will always touch in some point or other (as at m) & to which therefore all the curve lines βγ, δθ, λσ, &c: are perpendiculars.
3. Soe that every point (γ, θ, m, σ, &c:) of the line cdmσ, when it begineth or ceaseth to touch the curve line βδmλ, doth then move perpendicularly to or from it: & therefore the line γdmσ doth not at all slide upon the curve line βδmλ, but exactly measure it by applying it selfe to it point by point: & therefore the correspondent parts of the said lines are equall (viz: βm=γm. δm=θm. δλ=θσ. &c).
Resol. Take any Equation for the nature of the crooked line acg, & by the 2d probleme find the center m of its crookedness at c. That point m is a point of the required curve line βδmλ. For that point m whereat cdmσ the perpendicular to acg doth touch the curve line βδmλ is lesse moved than any other point of the said perpendicular, being as it were the hinge & center upon | about which the perpendicular turneth | moveth at that moment.
Example 1. If acg is a Parabola whose nature (supposing ab=x⊥bc=y) is rx=yy. By Theoreme the 1st of Problem 2d I find cb+lm=y+ . By the 2d Theoreme, bl=2x+r. And by the 3d Theoreme . Soe that supposing ab=r. bl=3x=z. . The relation twixt v & z will bee 27rvv=16z3, (for r4vv=16y6=16y3x3=) which is the nature of the required line βδmλ. And since cγ=aβ=r. Therefore . is the length of its parte βδm.
Example 2. Soe if aa=xy, is the nature of the line acg. By the afforesaid Theoreme I find, cb+lm=; &, ; whereby the nature of the curve line βδmλ is determined. And lastly I find  which determine its length.

Prob: 10. Any curve line being given to find other lines whose lengths may be compared to its length or to its area, & to compare them.
Resolution. Take any Equation for the  relation twixt ad & the perpendicular cd=y (whither that relation bee expressed by an Equation or whither it bee the same which some streight line beares to a curved one or to its superficies &c). Then (by prop 7) find the relation twixt the increase or decrease (p & q) of the lines ad=x, & dc=y. & say (by prop 6) that q∶p∷dc∶dn= . And soe is the triangle dnc (rectanguled at c) given & consequently the Nature of the curve line acg to which dc is perpendicular, & cn a tangent.
Now the center (m) of the perpendiculars motion (which gives the nature & length of the required curve line βm) may be found as in the 2d or 9th Probleme, But more conveniently thus. Draw any fixed line he∥ad⊥ah=a=ef⊥ad. Also call fd=v. & the increase or decrease of (fd) call r. And the increase or decrease of the motions p & q, call β & γ Now considering that the motion (p+r) of the intersection point e in the line he is to the motion (p) of the intersection point (d) in the line (ad), as (em) is to (dm) (see prob 2); That is that the difference (r) of those motions is to the motion (p) of the point (b) soe is (ed) to (dm): First I find the valor of v. viz  ∶q∷cn∶cd∷ef=a∶fd=v= . Or aaqq+vvqq−vvpp=0. Secondly by this Equation I find the valor of r, viz: (by Prob 7), 2aaqγ+2vvqγ+2rvqq−2rvpp−2vvpβ=0. Thirdly  . Lastly supposing the motion p to bee uniforme that its increase or decrease β may vanish, & also substituting ppzz the valor of aaqq+vvqq in its stead in the Denominator of dm, the result will bee  , if p=1. And to find the lines dl & ml, say −p∶q∷dm∶dl= . &  
Soe that by the equation expressing the relation twixt x & y first I finde q & then γ. which two give me  &c.
Example 1. If the relation twixt x & y bee supposed to bee yy−ax=0. Then (by Prop 7) I find, first 2qy−ap=0, Or 2qy−a=0. & secondly 2γy+2qq=0. And substituting these valors of  & γ= in their stead in the Equation  , &c: The results will bee  .  . &  . (And adding cd=−y to dm, & ad=x = to dl, the result is cm= . & al= .) Which determine the nature & crookednesse of the line βm. (For if aβ= . βl=z. lm=v. The relation twixt z & v will bee 16z3=27rvv. The length of βm being  . as before was found).
Example the 2d. If x=ad⊥dk= , is the nature of the  crooked line (the Hyperbola) gkw: And I would find other crooked lines (βm) whose lengths may bee compared with the area sdkg (calling as=b⊥gs) of that crooked line gkw. I call <60r> that area sdkg=ξ, & its motion θ. Now since 1∶dk∷p∶θ, (see prob 5. & the Note on prop 7 in Example 3); Therefore dk×p=dk=θ= . This being knowne I take at pleasure any Equation, in which ξ is, for the valor of cd=y.
As 1st suppose ay=ξ, That (by prop 7) gives aq=θ= , Or qx=a; which also (by prop 7) gives γx+qp=0. Which valors of q= , & γ= ; by helpe of the Theorems  &c: doe give  .  . &  . which determines the nature of the required curve line βm. The length of that portion of it which is intercepted twixt the point m & the curve line acg being −cm=cd+dm= , Or mc= .
 [Note that in this case although the area sdkg=ξ cannot bee Geometrically found & therefore the line acg is a Mechanicall one yet the desired line βm is a Geometricall one. And the like will happen in all other such like cases, when in the Equation taken at pleasure to expresse the relation twixt x, y, & ξ; neither x, y, nor ξ doe multiply or divide one another, nor it selfe, nor is in any denominator or roote, except x which may multiply it selfe & bee in denominators & rootes, when y or ξ are not in those fractions or rootes & herein onely doth this excell the precedent 9th probleme. Such is this Equation aξ−aby+ax3+ . &c: But not this ξξ=a3y. nor ξ=xy. &c]
Secondly suppose ξ=xy. that (by prop 7) give θ=y+xq= , Or xy+xxq=aa, & that (by prop 7) gives y+qx+2qx+γxx=0. Which two valors of  , And  ; by meanes of the Theoremes  ,  , &  ; doe determine the nature & length of the desired curve line βm.
Example the 3d. In like manner to find curve lines whose lengths may bee compared to the length gk of the said curve (Hyperbola) gkw. Call gk=ξ, & its motion θ. Now, drawing kh the tangent to gkw at k, I consider that ad=x & gk=ξ doe increase in the proportion of dh to kh; that is, dh∶kh∷p∶θ. Now finding (by prob 1) that dh=−x, &  ; therefore is  . Which being found, I take any equation, in which ξ is, for the valor of cd=y. & then worke as in the precedent Example.
Note that by this or the Ninth Probleme may bee gathered a Catalogue of whatever lines, whose lengths can bee Geometrically found.

Definition. 1. I call that point the center of Motion in any Body, which always rests when or howsoever that Body circulates without progressive motion. It would always bee the same with the center of Gravity were the Rays of Gravity parallel & not converging towards the center of the Earth.
Def: 2 And the right lines passing through that point I call the axes of Motion or Gravity.
Lemma 1 The place & distance of Bodys is determinded by their center of Gravity. Which is the middle point of a right line circle or Parallelogram:
Lemma 2 Those weights doe equiponderate whose quantitys are reciprocally proportionall to their distances from the common axis of Gravity, supposing their centers of Gravity to bee in the same plaine with that common axis of Gravity.
Prob To find the center of Gravity in rectilinear plaine figures

In the Trapezium abdc, draw ad & cb. Ioyne the centers of  Gravity e & h, f & g of the opposite triangles acb & dcb, bad & adc with the lines eh, fg. Their intersection point n is the center of Gravity in the Trapezium. (And so of Pentagons, hexagones &c)
Prob: To find such plaine figures which are equiponderate to any given plaine figure in respect of an axis of Gravity in any given position.
Resol That the natures & positions of the given curvilinear plaine (gbc,) & sought plaine (bde) bee such that they may equiponderate in respect of the axis (ak;) I suppose x=ab⊥bc=z, & y=ad⊥de=v to bee either perpendicular or parallel or coincident to the said axis ak: And the motions whereby x & y doe increase or decrease (i:e: the motions of bc, & de to or from the point a) I call p & q. Now the ordinatly applyed lines bc=z, & de=v, multiplyed into their motion p & q (that is, pz, & qv) may signify the infinitly little parts of those areas (acb, & lde) which each moment they describe; which infinitly little parts doe equiponderate (by Lemma 1 & 2), if they multiplied by their distances from the axis ak doe make equall products. (that is; pxz=qyv, in fig 1: pxz=qvv in fig 2: pzz=qv×fm, in fig 3; supposing dm=me. &) And if all the respective infinitly little parts doe equiponderate the superficies must do so too.

Trin: Coll Cambridge. Feb. 6. 167
Sir
To perform my late promise to you, I shall without further ceremony acquaint you, that in the beginning of the year 1666 (at which time I applyed my self to the grinding of Optick glasses of other figures then Sphericall) I procured me a triangular glasse Prisme to try therewith the celebrated phænomena of colours. And in order thereto having darkned my chamber & made a small hole in my window-shuts to let in a convenient quantity of the sun's light, I placed my Prism at its entrance that it might be thereby refracted to the opposite wall. It was at first a very pleasing divertisement to view the vivid & intense colours produced thereby; but after a while applying my selfe to consider them more circumspectly, I became surprized to see them in an oblong form, which according to the received lawes of refraction I expected should have been circular.
They were terminated at the sides with streight lines, but at the ends the decay of light was so graduall that it was difficult to determine justly what was their figure, yet they seemed semicircular.
Comparing the length of this Coloured Spectrum with its bredth I found it about five times greater, a disproportion soe extravagant that it excited me to a more then ordinary curiosity of examining from whence it might proceed; I could scarce think that the various thicknesse of the glasse, or the termination with shaddow or darknesse could have any influence on light to produce such an effect, yet I thought it not amisse to examine first those circumstances, & soe tryed what would happen by transmitting light through parts of the glasse of divers thicknesses, or through holes in the window of divers bignesses, or by setting the Prism without, so that the light might passe through it & bee refracted before it was terminated by the hole: but I found none of those circumstances materiall. The fashion of the colours was in all these cases the same.
Then I suspected whither by any unnevenesse in the glass or other contingent irregularity these colours might be thus dilated. And to try this I took another prism like the former & soe placed it that the light passing through them both might be refracted contrary wayes & so by the latter <460v> returned into that course from which the former had diverted it. ffor by this meanes I thought the regular effects of the first Prism would be destroyed by the sceond Prism, but the irregular ones more augmented by the multiplicity of refractions. The event was that the light which by the first Prism was diffused into an oblong form was by the second reduced into an orbicular one with as much regularity as when it did not at all passe through them. So that what ever was the cause of that length 'twas not any contingent irregularity.
I then proceded to examine more critically what might be effected by the difference of the incidence of rayes comming from divers parts of the Sun, & to that end measured the severall lines & angles belonging to the image. Its distance from the hole or Prism was 22 foot, its utmost length 13 inches, its breadth 2 inches, the diameter of the hole  of an inch, the angle which the rayes tending towards the midle of the image made with those lines in which they would have proceeded without refraction 44 degr. 56'. And the verticall angle of the Prism 63 degr 12'. Also the refractions on both sides the Prism, that is of the incident & emergent rayes were as near as I could make them, equall, & consequently about 54 degr 4'. And the rayes fell perpendicularly upon the wall. Now subducting the diameter of the hole from the length & breadth of the image there remains 13 inches the length & 2 the breadth comprehended by those rayes which passed through the center of the {said} hole & consequently the angle at the hole which that breadth su{bten}ded was about 31' answerable to the sun's diameter, but the ang{le} which its length subtended was more then five such diameters, namely 2 degr 49'.
Having made these observations I first computed from them the refractive power of that glasse & found it measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31. And then by that ratio I computed the refractions of two rayes flowing from opposite parts of the sun's discus, so as to differ 31' in their obliquity of incidence, & found that the emergent rayes should have comprehended an angle of about 31' as they did before they were incident.
But because this computation was founded on the Hypothesis of the proportionality of the Sines of incidence & refraction, which, though by my own & others experience, I could not imagine to be so erroneous as to make that angle but 31' which in reality was 2 degr 49' yet my curiosity caused me again to take my Prism. And having placed it at my window as before I observed that by turning it a little about its axis to & fro, so as to vary its obliquity to the light more then by an angle of 4 or 5 degrees, the colours were not thereby sensibly translated from their place on the wall, & consequently by that variation of incidence, the quantity of refraction was not sensibly varied.
<461r>
By this experiment therefore as well as by the former computation it was evident that the difference of the incidence of rayes flowing from divers parts of the Sun, could not make them after decussation diverge at a sensibly greater angle then that at which they before converged. which being at most but about 31. or 32 minutes, there still remained some other cause to be found out from whence it could be 2 degr 49'.
Then I began to suspect whither the rayes after their trajection through the Prism did not move in curve lines & acording to their more or lesse curvity tend to divers parts of the wall. And it increased my suspicion when I remembred that I had often seen a Tennis-ball struck with an oblique Racket describe such a curve line. for a circular as well as a progressive motion being communicated to it by that stroak, its parts on that side where the motions conspire must presse & beat the contiguous air more violently then on the other, & there excite a reluctancy & reaction of the air proportionally greater. And for the same reason, if the rayes of light should possibly bee globular bodyes & by their oblique passage out of one medium into another acquire a circulating motion, they ought to feel the greater resistance from the ambient Æther on that side where the motions conspire & thence be continually bowed to the other. But notwithstanding this plausible ground of suspicion when I came to examine it I could observe noe such curvity in them. And besides (which was enough for my purpose) I observed that the difference betwixt the length of the image & diameter of the hole through which the light was transmitted, was proportionable to their distance.
The graduall removall of these suspicions at length led me to the experimentum crucis; which was this. I took two boards, & placed one of them close behind the Prism at the window, so that the light might passe through a small hole made in it for that purpose & fall on the other board which I placed at about twelve foot distance, having first made a small hole in it also for some of that incident light to passe through. Then I placed another Prism behind this second board so that the light trajected through both the boards might passe through that also <461v> & be again refracted before it arrived at the wall. This done, I took the first Prism in my hand & turned it to & fro slowly about its axis so much as to make the severall parts of the image cast on the second board, successively passe through the hole in it, that I might observe to what places on the wall the second Prism would refract them. And I saw by the variation of those places, that the light tending to that end of the image towards which the refraction of the first Prism was made, did in the second Prism suffer a refraction considerably greater then the light tending to the other end. And soe the true cause of the length of that image was detected to be noe other then that light consists of rayes differently refrangible which without any respect to a difference in their incidence were according to their degrees of refrangibility transmitted towards diverse parts of the wall.
When I understood this, I left of my aforesaid glassworkes, for I saw that the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions of Optick Authors, which all men have hitherto imagined, as because that light it selfe is a heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible rayes. So that were a Glasse so exactly figured as to collect any one sort of rayes into one point, it could not collect those also int{o} the same point which having the same incidence upon the same medium are apt to suffer a different refraction. I wondered that seing the difference of refrangibility was soe great as I found it, Telescopes should arrive to that perfection thay are now at. ffor measuring the refractions in one of my Prisms I found that supposing the common sine of incidence upon one of its planes was 44 parts, the sine of refraction of the utmost rayes on the red end of the colours made out of the glasse into the air would be 68 parts, & the sine of refraction of the utmost rayes on the other end 69 parts. So that the difference is about a 24th or 25t part of the whole refraction. And consequently the objectglasse of any Telescope cannot collect all the rayes which come from one point of an object, so as to make them convene at its focus in lesse room then in a circular space whose diameter is the part of the diameter of its spectrum. <462r> which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater then a circularly figured lens, of so small a section as the objectglasses of long Telescopes are, would cause by the unfitnesse of its figure, were light uniform.
This made me take reflections into consideration; & finding them regular, so that the angle of reflection of all sorts of rayes was equall to their angle of incidence I understood that by their mediation Optick instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable provided a reflecting substance could be found which would polish as finely as glasse, & reflect as much light as glasse transmitts, & the art of communicating to it a Parabolick figure bee also attained. But those seemed very great difficulties, & I almost thought them insuperable when I further considered that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rayes stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course then the like irregularities in a refracting one. So that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite then in figuring glasses for refraction.
Amidst these thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by the intervening Plague & it was more then two years before I proceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing proper for mettall, wherby as I imagined the figure also would be corrected to the last, I began to try what might be effected in this kind, & by degrees so far perfected an instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I sent to London) by which I could discern Iupiters four concomitants, & showed them divers times to two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the moon-like phase of Venus, but not very distinctly nor without some nicenesse in disposing the instrument.
ffrom that time I was interrupted till this last Autumn, when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better then the first, (especially for day Objects) so I doubt not but they will be still brought to a much greater perfection by their endeavours who as you inform me are taking care about it at London.
I have sometimes thought to make a microscope which in like manner should have instead of an objectglasse a relecting piece of metall. And this I hope they will also take into consideration <462v> For those instruments seem as capable of improvement as Telescopes, & perhaps more because but one reflective peice of metall is requisite in them, as you may perceive by the annexed diagram where A B representeth the  object metall, C D the eyeglasse, F their common focus, & O the other focus of the metall in which the object is placed. But to return from this digression, I told you that light is not similar or homogeneall but consists of difform rayes, some of which are more refrangible then others. So that of those which are alike incident on the same medium, some shall be more refracted then others, & that not by any virtue of the glasse or other externall cause, but from a predisposition which every particular ray hath to suffer a particular degree of refraction. I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable difformity in its rayes wherin the origen of colours is infolded. A naturalist would scarce expect to see the science of those become mathematicall, & yet I dare affirm that there is as much certainty in it as in any other part of Opticks. ffor what I shall tell concerning them is not an Hypoth{esis} but most rigid consequence, not conjectured by barely infer{ring} 'tis thus because not otherwise or because it satisfies all phænomena (the Philosophers universall Topick,) but evinced by the mediation of experiments concluding directly & without any suspicion of doubt. To continue the historicall narration of these experiments would make a discourse too tedious & confused, & therefore I shall rather lay down the doctrine first, & then for its examination give you an instance or two of the experiments as a Specimen of the rest.
The Doctrine you will find comprehended & illustrated in the following propositions.
1. As the rayes of light differ in degrees of refrangibility, so they also differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular colour. Colours are not qualifications of light derived from refractions or reflections of naturall bodies as 'tis generally beleived, but originall & connate properties, which in diverse rayes are divers, some rayes are disposed to exhibit a red colour & noe other, <463r> some a yellow & noe other, some a green & noe other & so of the rest. Nor are there only rayes proper & peculiar to the more eminent colours, but even to all their intermediate gradations.
2. To the same degree of refrangibility ever belongs the same colour, & to the same colour ever belongs the same degree of refrangibility. The least-refrangible rayes are all disposed to exhibit a red colour & contrarily those rayes which are disposed to exhibit a red colour are all the least refrangible. So the most refrangible rayes are all disposed to exhibit a deep violett colour & contrarily those which are apt to exhibit such a violet colour are all the most refrangible. And so to all the intermediate colours in a continued series belong intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And this Analogy 'twixt colours & refrangibility is very precise & strict: the rayes always either exactly agreeing in both or proportionally disagreeing in both.
3. The Species of colour & degree of refrangibility proper to any particular sort of rayes, is not mutable by refraction, nor by reflection from naturall bodies, nor by any other cause that I could yet observe. When any one sort of rayes hath been well parted from those of other kinds it hath afterwards obstinately retained its colour notwithstanding my utmost endeavours to chang it. I have refracted it with Prismes, & reflected it with bodies which in day light were of other colours; I have intercepted it with the coloured film of air interceding two compressed plates of Glasse, transmitted it through coloured mediums & through mediums irradiated with other sort of rayes, & diversly terminated it, & yet could not produce any new colour out of it. It would by contracting or dilating become more brisk or faint, & by the losse of many rayes in some cases very obscure & dark, but I could never see it changed in Specie.
4 Yet seeming transmutations of colours may be made where there is any mixture of divers sorts of rayes: ffor in such mixtures the component colours appear not, but by their mutuall allaying each other constitute a midling colour. And therefore if by refraction <463v> or any other of the aforesaid causes the difform rayes latent in such a mixture bee seperated, there shall emerge colours different from the colour of the composition. Which colours are not new generated but only made apparent by being parted. ffor if they be again intirely mixed & blended together, they will again compose that colour which they did before seperation. And for the same reason transmutations made by the convening of divers colours are not reall; for when the difform rayes are again severed they will exhibit the very same colours which they did before they entered the composition. As you see blew & yellow powders when finely mixed appear to the naked eye green & yet the colours of the component corpuscles are not thereby really transmuted, but only blended. ffor when veiwed with a good Microscope they still appear blew & yellow interspersedly.
5 There are therefore two sorts of colours. The one originall & simple; the other compounded of these. The originall or primary colours are Red, yellow, Green, Blew, & a violet purple; together with Orang, Indico, & an indefinite varietie of intemediate gradations.
6 The same colours in Specie with these primary ones may be also produced by composition: ffor a mixture of yellow & blew makes green, of red & yellow makes Orang of Orang & yellowish green makes yellow. And in generall if any two colours be mixed, which in the series of those generated by the Prism are not too far distant one from another, they by their mutuall alloy compound that colour which in the said series appeareth in the midway between them. But those which are situated at too great a distance doe not soe. Orang & Indico produce not the intermediate green, nor Scarlet & green the intermediate yellow.
7 But the most surprizing & wonderfull composition was that of whitenesse. There is noe one sort of rayes which alone can exhibit this. Tis ever compounded & to its composition are requisite all the aforesaid primary colours mixed in a due proportion. I have often with admiration beheld that all the colours of the Prism being made <464r> made to converge & thereby to be again mixed as they were in the light before it was incident upon the Prism, reproduced light intirely & perfectly white, & not at all sensibly differing from the direct light of the sun; unlesse when the glasses I used were not sufficiently clear, for then they would a little incline it to their colour.
8. Hence therefore it comes to passe that whitenesse is the usuall colour of light: ffor light is a confused agregate of rayes indued with all sorts of colours as they are promiscuously darted from the various parts of luminous bodies. And of such a confused agregate as I said is generated whitenesse if there be a due proportion of the ingredients; But if any one predominate, the light must incline to that colour as it happens in the blew flame of Brimstone, the yellow flame of a candle & the various colours of the fixt starrs.
9. These thinges considered, the manner how colours are produced by the Prism is evident. ffor of the rayes constituting the incident light since those which differ in colour proportionally differ in refrangibility, they by their unequall refractions must be severed & dispersed into an oblong form in an orderly succession from the least refracted scarlet to the most refracted violet. And for the same reason it is that objects when looked upon through a Prism appear coloured. ffor the difform rayes by their unequall refractions are made to diverge toward severall parts of the Retina & there expresse the images of thinges coloured as in the former case they did the sun's image upon a wall. And by this inequality of refractions they become not only coloured but also very confused & indistinct.
10 Why the colours of the rainbow appear in falling drops of rain is also from hence evident. ffor those drops which refract the rayes disposed to appear purple in greatest quantity to the Spectators eye, refract the rayes of other sorts soe much lesse as to make them passe beside it; & such are the dropes in the inside of the primary Bow & on the outside of the second or exterior one. <464v> So those drops which refract in greatest plenty the rayes apt to appear red toward the Spectators eye, refract those of other sorts soe much more as to make them passe beside it, & such are the drops on the exterior part of the Primary & interior part of the secondary Bow.
11. The odd Phænomena of an infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, leaf-Gold, fragments of coloured glasse, & some other transparently coloured bodies appearing in one position of one colour, & of another in another are on these grounds noe longer riddles. ffor those are substances apt to reflect one sort of light & transmit another; as may be seen in a dark Room by illuminating them with similar or uncompounded light. ffor then they appear of that colour only with which they are illuminated, but yet in one position more vivid & luminous then in another, accordingly as they are disposed more or lesse to reflect or transmit the incident colour.
12 ffrom hence also is manifest the reason of an unexpected experiment which Mr Hook somewhere in his Micrographia relates to have made with two Wedg-like transparent vessells filled the one with a red, the other with a blew liquor: Namely that though they were severally transparent enough yet both together became opake. ffor if one transmitted only red & the other only blew, no rayes could passe through both.
13 I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall conclude with this generall one, that the colours of all naturall bodies have noe other origin then this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty then another. And this I have experimented in a dark Room by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of divers colours. ffor by that means any bodie may be made to appear of any colour. They have there noe appropriate colour but ever appear of the colour cast upon them, but yet with this difference that they are most brisk & vivid in the light of their own day-light-colour. Minium appeareth there of any <465r> colour indifferently with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red; & so Bise appeareth indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blew. And therefore Minium reflecteth rayes of any colour, but most copiously those endowed with red; & consequently when illustrated with day-light, that is with all sorts of rayes promiscuously blended, those qualified with red shall abound most in the reflected light, & by their prevalence cause it to appear of that colour. And for the same reason Bise reflecting blew most copiously, shall appear blew by the excesse of those rayes in its reflected light; & the like of other bodies. And that this is the intire & adequate cause of their colours is manifest, because they have noe power to change or alter the colour of any sort of rays incident apart, but put on all colours indifferently with which they are enlightened.
These thinges being so, it can be no longer disputed whither there be colours in the dark, nor whither they be the qualityes of the objects wee see, no nor perhaps whether light be a bodie. ffor since colours are qualityes of light, having its rayes for their entire & imediate subject, how can wee think those rayes qualityes also, unlesse one quality may be the subject of & sustain another, which in effect is to call it substance. Wee should not know bodies for substances were it not for their sensible qualityes, & the principall of those being now found due to something else, wee have as good reason to beleive that to be a substance also. Besides who ever thought any quality to be a heterogeneous agregate such as light is discovered to be. But to determine more absolutely what light is, after what manner refracted, & by what modes or actions it produceth in our minds the Phantasms of colours, is not so easie. . And I shall not mingle conjectures with certaintyes.
Reviewing what I have written, I see the discours it selfe will lead to divers experiments sufficient <465v> for its examination: And therefore I shall not trouble you farther then to describe one of those which I have already insinuated.
In a darkned Room make a hole in the shutt of a window, whose diameter may conveniently be about a third part of an inch, to admitt a convenient quantity of the Sun's light. And then place a clear & colourlesse Prism to refract the entering light towards the further part of the Room: which as I said will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured image. Then place a lens of about three foot radius (suppose a broad object-glasse of a three foot Telescope) at the distance of about 4 or 5 foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, & made by its refraction to convene at a further distance of about 10 or 12 foot. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whitenesse again by being mingled. But it is requisite that the Prism & lens be placed steddy, & that the paper on which the colours are cast bee moved to & fro; for by such motion you will not only find at what distance the whitenesse is most perfect, but also see how the colours gradually convene & vanish into whitenesse, & afterwards having crossed one another in that place where they compound whitenesse, are again dissipated & severed & in an inverted order retain the same colours which they had before they entered the composition. You may also see that if any of the colours at the lens be intercepted, the whitenesse will be changed into the other colours. And therefore that the composition of whitenesse be perfect, care must be taken that none of the colours fall beside the lens.
<466r>
In the annexed designe of this experiment  A B C representeth the Prism set endwise to sight, close by the hole F of the window E G. Its vertical angle A C B may conveniently be about 60 degrees. M N designes the lens. Its breadth 2 or 3 inches. S F one of the streight lines in which difform rayes may be conceived to flow successively from the Sun. F P & F R two of those rayes unequally refracted, which the Lens makes to converg towards Q, & after decussation to diverge again. And H I the paper at divers distances on which the colours are projected: which in Q constitute whitenesse, but are red & yellow in R, r, & ρ; & blew & purple in P, p & π.
If you proceed further to try the impossibility of changing any uncompounded colour, which I have asserted in the 3d and 13th propositions; 'tis requisite that the Room be made very dark, least any scattering light mixing with the colour, disturb & allay it & render it compound, contrary to the design of the experiment 'Tis also requisite that there be a perfecter seperation of the colours then after the manner above described can be made by the refraction of one single Prism; & how to make such further seperations will scarce be difficult to them that consider the discovered lawes of refractions. But if tryall shall be made with colours not throughly seperated there must be allowed changes proportionable <466v> to the mixture. Thus if compound yellow light fall upon blew Bise, the Bise will not appear perfectly yellow, but rather green, because there are in the yellow mixture many rayes indued with green, & green being lesse remote from the usuall blew colour of Bise then yellow, is more copiously reflected by it.
In like manner if any of the Prismatick colours, suppose Red, be intercepted on design to try the asserted impossibility of reproducing that colour out of the others which are pretermitted 'tis necessary either that the colours be very well parted before the red be intercepted, or that together with the red the neighbouring colours into which any red is secretly dispersed (that is the yellow & perhaps green too) bee intercepted, or else that allowance be made for the emerging of so much red out of the yellow & green as may possibly have been diffused & scattering{ly} blended in those colours. And if these thinges be observed the new production of Red or any intercepted colour will be found impossible.
This I conceive is enough for an introduction to experiments of this kind; which if any of the R Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what successe. That if any thing seem to be defective or to thwart this relation, I may have an opportunity of giving further direction about it, or of acknowledging my errors if I have committed any.

A Letter of Mr. Isaac Newton, Professor of the Mathematicks in the University of Cambridge; containing his New Theory about Light and Colors: sent by the Author to the Publisher from Cambridge, Febr. 6. 16; in order to be communicated to the R. Society.
SIR,
TO perform my late promise to you, I shall without further ceremony acquaint you, that in the beginning of the Year 1666 (at which time I applyed my self to the grinding of Optick glasses of other figures than Spherical,) I procured me a Triangular glass-Prisme, to try therewith the celebrated Phænomena of <3076> Colours. And in order thereto having darkened my chamber, and made a small hole in my window-shuts, to let in a convenient quantity of the Suns light, I placed my Prisme at his entrance, that it might be thereby refracted to the opposite wall. It was at first a very pleasing divertisement, to view the vivid and intense colours produced thereby; but after a while applying my self to consider them more circumspectly, I became surprised to see them in an oblong form; which, according to the received laws of Refraction, I expected should have been circular.
They were terminated at the sides with streight lines, but at the ends, the decay of light was so gradual, that it was difficult to determine justly, what was their figure; yet they seemed semicircular.
Comparing the length of this coloured Spectrum with its breadth, I found it about five times greater; a disproportion so extravagant, that it excited me to a more then ordinary curiosity of examining, from whence it might proceed. I could scarce think, that the various Thickness of the glass, or the termination with shadow or darkness, could have any Influence on light to produce such an effect; yet I thought it not amiss, first to examine those circumstances, and so tryed, what would happen by transmitting light through parts of the glass of divers thicknesses, or through holes in the window of divers bignesses, or by setting the Prisme without so, that the light might pass through it, and be refracted before it was terminated by the hole: But I found none of those circumstances material. The fashion of the colours was in all these cases the same.
Then I suspected, whether by any unevenness in the glass, or other contingent irregularity, these colours might be thus dilated. And to try this, I took another Prisme like the former, and so placed it, that the light, passing through them both, might be refracted contrary ways, and so by the latter returned into that course, from which the former had diverted it. For, by this means I thought, the regular effects of the first Prisme would be destroyed by the second Prisme, but the irregular ones more augmented, by the multiplicity of refractions. The event was, that the light, which by the first Prisme was diffused into an oblong form, was by the second reduced into an orbicular one with as much regularity, as when it did not at all pass through them. So that, what ever was the cause of that length, 'twas not any contingent irregularity
<3077>
I then proceeded to examin more critically, what might be effected by the difference of the incidence of Rays coming from divers parts of the Sun; and to that end, measured the several lines and angles, belonging to the Image. Its distance from the hole or Prisme was 22 foot; its utmost length 13 inches; its breadth 2; the diameter of the hole  of an inch; the angle, with the Rays, tending towards the middle of the image, made with those lines, in which they would have proceeded without refraction, was 44 deg. 56'. And the vertical Angle of the Prisme, 63 deg. 12'. Also the Refractions on both sides of the Prisme, that is, of the Incident, and Emergent Rays, were as near, as I could make them, equal, and consequently about 54 deg. 4'. And the Rays fell perpendicularly upon the wall. Now subducting the diameter of the hole from the length and breadth of the Image, there remains 13 Inches the length, and 2 the breadth, comprehended by those Rays, which passed through the center of the said hole, and consequently the angle of the hole, which that breadth subtended, was about 31', answerable to the Suns Diameter; but the angle, which its length subtended, was more then five such diameters, namely 2 deg. 49'.
Having made these observations, I first computed from them the refractive power of that glass, and found it measured by the ratio of the sines, 20 to 31. And then, by that ratio, I computed the Refractions of two Rays flowing from opposite parts of the Sun's discus, so as to differ 31' in their obliquity of Incidence, and found, that the emergent Rays should have comprehended an angle of about 31', as they did, before they were incident.
But because this computation was founded on the Hypothesis of the proportionality of the sines of Incidence, and Refraction, which though by my own Experience I could not imagine to be so erroneous, as to make that Angle but 31', which in reality was 2 deg. 49'; yet my curiosity caused me again to take my Prisme. And having placed it at my window, as before, I observed, that by turning it a little about its axis to and fro, so as to vary its obliquity to the light, more then an angle of 4 or 5 degrees, the Colours were not thereby sensibly translated from their place on the wall, and consequently by that variation of Incidence, the quantity of Refraction was not sensibly varied. By this Experiment therefore, as well as by the former computation, it was evident, that the difference of the Incidence of Rays, flowing from divers <3078> parts of the Sun, could not make them after decussation diverge at a sensibly greater angle, than that at which they before converged; which being, at most, but about 31 or 32 minutes, there still remained some other cause to be found out, from whence it could be 2 degr. 49'.
Then I began to suspect, whether the Rays, after their trajection through the Prisme, did not move in curve lines, and according to their more or less curvity tend to divers parts of the wall. And it increased my suspition, when I remembred that I had often seen a Tennis ball, struck with an oblique Racket, describe such a curve line. For, a circular as well as a progressive motion being communicated to it by that stroak, its parts on that side, where the motions conspire, must press and beat the contiguous Air more violently than on the other, and there excite a reluctancy and reaction of the Air proportionably greater. And for the same reason, if the Rays of light should possibly be globular bodies, and by their oblique passage out of one medium into another acquire a circulating motion, they ought to feel the greater resistance from the ambient Æther, on that side, where the motions conspire, and thence be continually bowed to the other. But notwithstanding this plausible ground of suspition, when I came to examine it, I could observe no such curvity in them. And besides (which was enough for my purpose) I observed, that the difference 'twixt the length of the Image, and diameter of the hole, through which the light was transmitted, was proportionable to their distance.
The gradual removal of these suspitions, at length led me to the Experimentum Crucis, which was this: I took two boards, and placed one of them close behind the Prisme at the window, so that the light might pass through a small hole, made in it for the purpose, and fall on the other board, which I placed at about 12 feet distance, having first made a small hole in it also, for some of that Incident light to pass through. Then I placed another Prisme behind this second board, so that the light, trajected through both the boards, might pass through that also, and be again refracted before it arrived at the wall. This done, I took the first Prisme in my hand, and turned it to and fro slowly about its Axis, so much as to make the several parts of the Image, cast on the second board, successively pass through the hole in it, that I might observe to what places on the wall the second Prisme would refract them. <3079> And I saw by the variation of those places, that the light, tending to that end of the Image, towards which the refraction of the first Prisme was made, did in the second Prisme suffer a Refraction considerably greater then the light tending to the other end. And so the true cause of the length of that Image was detected to be no other, then that Light consists of Rays differently refrangible, which, without any respect to a difference in their incidence, were, according to their degrees of refrangibility, transmitted towards divers parts of the wall.
When I understood this, I left off my aforesaid Glass works; for I saw, that the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited, not so much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions of Optick Authors, (which all men have hitherto imagined,) as because that Light it self is a Heterogeneous mixture of differently refrangible Rays. So that, were a glass so exactly figured, as to collect any one sort of rays into one point, it could not collect those also into the same point, which having the same Incidence upon the same Medium are apt to suffer a different refraction. Nay, I wondered, that seeing the difference of refrangibility was so great, as I found it, Telescopes should arrive to that perfection they are now at. For, measuring the refractions in one of my Prismes, I found, that supposing the common sine of Incidence upon one of its planes was 44 parts, the sine of refraction of the utmost Rays on the red end of the Colours, made out of the glass into the Air, would be 68 parts, and the sine of refraction of the utmost rays on the other end, 69 parts: So that the difference is about a 24th or 25th part of the whole refraction. And consequently, the object-glass of any Telescope cannot collect all the rays, which come from one point of an object so as to make them convene at its focus in less room then in a circular space, whose diameter is the 50th part of the Diameter of its Aperture; which is an irregularity, some hundreds of times greater, then a circularly figured Lens, of so small a section as the Object glasses of long Telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its figure, were Light uniform.
This made me take Reflections into consideration, and finding them regular, so that the Angle of Reflection of all sorts of Rays was equal to their Angle of Incidence; I understood, that by their mediation Optick instruments might be brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided a Reflecting substance could be <3080> found, which would polish as finely as Glass, and reflect as much light, as glass transmits, and the art of communicating to it a Parabolick figure be also attained. But there seemed very great difficulties, and I have almost thought them insuperable, when I further considered, that every irregularity in a reflecting superficies makes the rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of their due course, than the like irregularities in a refracting one: So that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite, than in figuring glasses for Refraction.
Amidst these thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by the Intervening Plague, and it was more then two years, before I proceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polishing, proper for metall, whereby, as I imagined, the figure also would be corrected to the last; I began to try, what might be effected in this kind, and by degrees so far perfected an Instrument (in the essential parts of it like that I sent to London,) by which I could discern Jupiters 4 Concomitants, and shewed them divers times to two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the Moon-like phase of Venus, but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in disposing the Instrument.
From that time I was interrupted till this last Autumn, when I made the other. And as that was sensibly better then the first (especially for Day-Objects,) so I doubt not, but they will be still brought to a much greater perfection by their endeavours, who, as you inform me, are taking care about it at London.
I have sometimes thought to make a Microscope, which in like manner should have, instead of an Object-glass, a Reflecting piece of metall. And this I hope they will also take into consideration. For those Instruments seem as capable of improvement as Telescopes, and perhaps more, because but one reflective piece of metall is requisite in them, as you may perceive by the annexed diagram, where A Brepresenteth the object metall, C D the eye glass, F their common Focus, and O the other focus of the metall, in which the object is placed.
<3081>
But to return from this digression, I told you, that Light is not similar, or homogeneal, but consists of difform Rays, some of which are more refrangible than others: So that of those, which are alike incident on the same medium, some shall be more refracted than others, and that not by any virtue of the glass, or other external cause, but from a predisposition, which every particular Ray hath to suffer a particular degree of Refraction.
I shall now proceed to acquaint you with another more notable difformity in its Rays, wherein the Origin of Colours is unfolded: Concerning which I shall lay down the Doctrine first, and then, for its examination, give you an instance or two of the Experiments, as a specimen of the rest.
The Doctrine you will find comprehended and illustrated in the following propositions.
1. As the Rays of light differ in degrees of Refrangibility, so they also differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular colour. Colours are not Qualifications of Light, derived from Refractions, or Reflections of natural Bodies (as 'tis generally believed,) but Original and connate properties, which in divers Rays are divers. Some Rays are disposed to exhibit a red colour and no other; some a yellow and no other, some a green and no other, and so of the rest. Nor are there only Rays proper and particular to the more eminent colours, but even to all their intermediate gradations.
2. To the same degree of Refrangibility ever belongs the same colour, and to the same colour ever belongs the same degree of Refrangibility. The least Refrangible Rays are all disposed to exhibit a Red colour, and contrarily those Rays, which are disposed to exhibit a Red colour, are all the least refrangible: So the most refrangible Rays are all disposed to exhibit a deep Violet Colour, and contrarily those which are apt to exhibit such a violet colour, are all the most Refrangible. And so to all the intermediate colours in a continued series belong intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And this Analogy 'twixt colours, and refrangibility, is very precise and strict; the Rays always either exactly agreeing in both, or proportionally disagreeing in both.
3. The species of colour, and degree of Refrangibility proper to any particular sort of Rays, is not mutable by Refraction, nor by Reflection from natural bodies, nor by any other cause, that I could yet observe. When any one sort of Rays hath been well <3082> parted from those of other kinds, it hath afterwards obstinately retained its colour, notwithstanding my utmost endeavours to change it. I have refracted it with Prismes, and reflected it with Bodies, which in Day-light were of other colours; I have intercepted it with the coloured film of Air interceding two compressed plates of glass; transmitted it through coloured Mediums, and through Mediums irradiated with other sorts of Rays, and diversly terminated it; and yet could never produce any new colour out of it. It would by contracting or dilating become more brisk, or faint, and by the loss of many Rays, in some cases very obscure and dark; but I could never see it changed in specie.
Yet seeming transmutations of Colours may be made, where there is any mixture of divers sorts of Rays. For in such mixtures, the component colours appear not, but, by their mutual allaying each other, constitute a midling colour. And therefore, if by refraction, or any other of the aforesaid causes, the difform Rays, latent in such a mixture, be separated, there shall emerge colours different from the colour of the composition. Which colours are not New generated, but only made Apparent by being parted; for if they be again intirely mix't and blended together, they will again compose that colour, which they did before separation. And for the same reason, Transmutations made by the convening of divers colours are not real; for when the difform Rays are again severed, they will exhibit the very same colours, which they did before they entered the composition; as you see, Blew and Yellow powders, when finely mixed, appear to the naked eye Green, and yet the colours of the Component corpuscles are not thereby really transmuted, but only blended. For, when viewed with a good Microscope, they still appear Blew and Yellow interspersedly.
5. There are therefore two sorts of Colours. The one original and simple, the other compounded of these. The Original or primary colours are, Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, and a Violet-purple, together with Orange, Indico, and an indefinite variety of Intermediate gradations.
6. The same colours in Specie with these Primary ones may be also produced by composition: For, a mixture of Yellow and Blew makes Green; of Red and Yellow makes Orange; of Orange and Yellowish green makes yellow. And in general, if any two Colours be mixed, which in the series of those, generated by the Prisme, are <3083> not too far distant one from another, they by their mutual alloy compound that colour, which in the said series appeareth in the mid-way between them. But those, which are situated at too great a distance, do not so. Orange and Indico produce not the intermediate Green, nor Scarlet and Green the intermediate yellow.
7. But the most surprising, and wonderful composition was that of Whiteness. There is no one sort of Rays which alone can exhibit this. 'Tis ever compounded, and to its composition are requisite all the aforesaid primary Colours, mixed in a due proportion. I have often with Admiration beheld, that all the Colours of the Prisme being made to converge, and thereby to be again mixed as they were in the light before it was Incident upon the Prisme, reproduced light, intirely and perfectly white, and not at all sensibly differing from a direct Light of the Sun, unless when the glasses, I used, were not sufficiently clear; for then they would a little incline it to their colour.
8. Hence therefore it comes to pass, that Whiteness is the usual colour of Light; for, Light is a confused aggregate of Rays indued with all sorts of Colors, as they are promiscuously darted from the various parts of luminous bodies. And of such a confused aggregate, as I said, is generated Whiteness, if there be a due proportion of the Ingredients; but if any one predominate, the Light must incline to that colour; as it happens in the Blew flame of Brimstone; the yellow flame of a Candle; and the various colours of the Fixed stars.
9. These things considered, the manner, how colours are produced by the Prisme, is evident. For, of the Rays, constituting the incident light, since those which differ in Colour proportionally differ in Refrangibility, they by their unequall refractions must be severed and dispersed into an oblong form in an orderly succession from the least refracted Scarlet to the most refracted Violet. And for the same reason it is, that objects, when looked upon through a Prisme, appear coloured. For, the difform Rays, by their unequal Refractions, are made to diverge towards several parts of the Retina, and there express the Images of things coloured, as in the former case they did the Suns Image upon a wall. And by this inequality of refractions they become not only coloured, but also very confused and indistinct
10. Why the Colours of the Rainbow appear in falling drops <3084> of Rain, is also from hence evident. For, those drops, which refract the Rays, disposed to appear purple, in greatest quantity to the Spectators eye, refract the Rays of other sorts so much less, as to make them pass beside it; and such are the drops on the inside of the Primary Bow, and on the outside of the Secondary or Exteriour one. So those drops, which refract in greatest plenty the Rays, apt to appear red, toward the Spectators eye, refract those of other sorts so much more, as to make them pass beside it; and such are the drops on the exteriour part of the Primary, and interiour part of the Secondary Bow.
11. The odd Phænomena of an infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, Leaf gold, Fragments of coloured glass, and some other transparently coloured bodies, appearing in one position of one colour, and of another in another, are on these grounds no longer riddles. For, those are substances apt to reflect one sort of light and transmit another; as may be seen in a dark room, by illuminating them with similar or uncompounded light. For, then they appear of that colour only, with which they are illuminated, but yet in one position more vivid and luminous than in another, accordingly as they are disposed more or less to reflect or transmit the incident colour.
12. From hence also is manifest the reason of an unexpected Experiment, which Mr. Hook somewhere in his Micrography relates to have made with two wedg-like transparent vessels, fill'd the one with red, the other with a blew liquor: namely that though they were severally transparent enough, yet both together became opake; For, if one transmitted only red, and the other only blew, no rays could pass through both.
13. I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall conclude with this general one, that the Colours of all natural Bodies have no other origin than this, that they are variously qualified to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty then another. And this I have experimented in a dark Room by illuminating those bodies with uncompounded light of divers colours. For by that means any body may be made to appear of any colour. They have there no appropriate colour, but ever appear of the colour of the light cast upon them, but yet with this difference, that they are most brisk and vivid in the light of their own day-light-colour. Minium appeareth there of any colour indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in red, and so <3085> Bise appeareth indifferently of any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in blew. And therefore Minium reflecteth Rays of any colour, but most copiously those indued with red; and consequently when illustrated with day-light, that is, with all sorts of Rays promiscuously blended, those qualified with red shall abound most in the reflected light, and by their prevalence cause it to appear of that colour. And for the same reason Bise, reflecting blew most copiously, shall appear blew by the excess of those Rays in its reflected light; and the like of other bodies. And that this is the intire and adequate cause of their colours, is manifest, because they have no power to change or alter the colours of any sort of Rays incident apart, but put on all colours indifferently, with which they are inlightned.
These things being so, it can no longer be disputed, whether there be colours in the dark, nor whether they be the qualities of the objects we see, no nor perhaps, whether Light be a Body. For, since Colours are the qualities of Light, having its Rays for their intire and immediate subject, how can we think those Rays qualities also, unless one quality may be the subject of and sustain another; which in effect is to call it Substance. We should not know Bodies for substances, were it not for their sensible qualities, and the Principal of those being now found due to something else, we have as good reason to believe that to be a Substance also.
Besides, whoever thought any quality to be a heterogeneous aggregate, such as Light is discovered to be. But, to determine more absolutely, what Light is, after what manner refracted, and by what modes or actions it produceth in our minds the Phantasms of Colours, is not so easie. And I shall not mingle conjectures with certainties.
Reviewing what I have written, I see the discourse it self will lead to divers Experiments sufficient for its examination: And therefore I shall not trouble you further, than to describe one of those, which I have already insinuated.
In a darkened Room make a hole in the shut of a window, whose diameter may conveniently be about a third part of an inch, to admit a convenient quantity of the Suns light: And there place a clear and colourless Prisme, to refract the entring light towards the further part of the Room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused into an oblong coloured Image. Then place a Lens of <3086> about three foot radius (suppose a broad Object-glass of a three foot Telescope,) at the distance of about four or five foot from thence, through which all those colours may at once be transmitted, and made by its Refraction to convene at a further distance of about ten or twelve feet. If at that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you will see the colours converted into whiteness again by being mingled. But it is requisite, that the Prisme and Lens be placed steddy, and that the paper, on which the colours are cast, be moved to and fro; for, by such motion, you will not only find, at what distance the whiteness is most perfect, but also see, how the colours gradually convene, and vanish into whiteness, and afterwards having crossed one another in that place where they compound Whiteness, are again dissipated, and severed, and in an inverted order retain the same colours, which they had before they entered the composition. You may also see, that, if any of the Colours at the Lens be intercepted, the Whiteness will be changed into the other colours. And therefore, that the composition of whiteness be perfect, care must be taken, that none of the colours fall besides the Lens.
In the annexed design of this Experiment, A B C expresseth the Prism set endwise to sight, close by the hole F of the window  E G. Its vertical Angle A C B may conveniently be about 60 degrees: M N designeth the Lens. Its breadth 2 or 3 inches. S F one of the streight lines, in which difform Rays may be conceived to flow successively from the Sun. F P, and F R two of those Rays unequally refracted, which the Lens makes to converge towards Q, and after decussation to diverge again. And H I the paper, at divers distances, on which the colours are projected: which in Q constitute Whiteness, but are Red and Yellow in R, r, and ρ and Blew and Purple in P, p, and π
<3087>
If you proceed further to try the impossibility of changing any uncompounded colour (which I have asserted in the third and thirteenth Propositions,) 'tis requisite that the Room be made very dark, least any scattering light, mixing with the colour, disturb and allay it, and render it compound, contrary to the design of the Experiment. 'Tis also requisite, that there be a perfecter separation of the Colours, than, after the manner above described, can be made by the Refraction of one single Prisme, and how to make such further separations, will scarce be difficult to them, that consider the discovered laws of Refractions. But if tryal shall be made with colours not throughly separated, there must be allowed changes proportionable to the mixture. Thus if compound Yellow light fall upon Blew Bise, the Bise will not appear perfectly yellow, but rather green, because there are in the yellow mixture many rays indued with green, and Green being less remote from the usual blew colour of Bise than yellow, is the more copiously reflected by it.
In like manner, if any one of the Prismatick colours, suppose Red, be intercepted, on design to try the asserted impossibility of reproducing that Colour out of the others which are pretermitted; 'tis necessary, either that the colours be very well parted before the red be interecepted, or that together with the red the neighbouring colours, into which any red is secretly dispersed, (that is, the yellow, and perhaps green too) be intercepted, or else, that allowance be made for the emerging of so much red out of the yellow green, as may possibly have been diffused, and scatteringly blended in those colours. And if these things be observed, the new Production of Red, or any intercepted colour will be found impossible.
This, I conceive, is enough for an Introduction to Experiments of this kind; which if any of the R. Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I should be very glad to be informed with what success: That, if any thing seem to be defective, or to thwart this relation, I may have an opportunity of giving further direction about it, or of acknowledging my errors, if I have commited any.
So far this Learned and very Ingenious Letter; which having been by that Illustrious Company, before whom it was read, with much applause committed to the consideration of some of their Fellows, well versed in this argument, the Reader may possibly in an other Tract be informed of some report given in upon this Discourse.

Mr. Isaac Newtons Answer to some Considerations upon his Doctrine of Light and Colors; which Doctrine was printed in Numb. 80. of these Tracts.
SIR, I have already told you, that at the perusal of the considerations, you sent me, on my Letter concerning Refractions and Colors, I found nothing, that, as I conceived, might not without difficulty be answer'd. And though I find the Considerer somewhat more concern'd for an Hypothesis, than I expected; yet I doubt not, but we have one common design; I mean, a sincere endeavour after knowledge, without valuing uncertain speculations for their subtleties, or despising certainties for their plainness: And on confidence of this it is, that I make this return to his discourse.*[1] 
[2] The first thing that offers it self is less agreeable to me, and I begin with it because it is so. The considerer is pleased to reprehend me for laying aside the thoughts of improving Optiques by Refractions. If he had obliged me by a private Letter on this occasion, I would have acquainted him with my successes on the Tryals I have made of that kind, which I shall now say have been less than I sometimes expected, and perhaps than he at present hopes for. But since he is pleased to take it for granted, that I have let this subject pass without due examination, I shall refer him to my former Letter,*[3] by which that conjecture will appear to be un-grounded. For, what I said there, was in respect of Telescopes of the ordinary construction, signifying, that their improvement is not to be expected from the well-figuring of Glasses, as Opticians have imagin'd; but I despaired not of their improvement by other constructions; which made me cautious to insert nothing that might intimate the contrary. For, although successive refractions that are all made the same way, do necessarily more and more augment the errors of the first refraction; yet it seem'd not impossible for contrary refractions so to correct each others inequalities, as to make their difference regular; and, if that <5085> could be conveniently effected, there would be no further difficulty. Now to this end I examin'd what may be done not only by Glasses alone, but more especially by a Complication of divers successive Mediums, as by two or more Glasses or Crystals with Water or some other fluid between them; all which together may perform the office of one Glass, especially of the Object-glass, on whose construction the perfection of the instrument chiefly depends. But what the results in Theory or by Tryals have been, I may possibly find a more proper occasion to declare.
To the Assertion, that Rays are less true reflected to a point by a Concave, than refracted by a Convex, I cannot assent; nor do I understand, that the focus of the latter is less a line than that of the former. The truth of the contrary you will rather perceive by this following Table, computed for such a Reflecting Concave, and Refracting convex, on supposition that they have equal Apertures, and collect parallel rays at an equal distance from their vertex; which distance being divided into 15000 parts, the Diameter of the Concave Sphere will be 60000 of those parts, and of the Convex, 10000; supposing the Sines of Incidence and Refraction to be, in round numbers, as 2 to 3. And this Table shews, how much the exterior rays, at several Apertures, fall short of their principal focus.

By this you may perceive, that the Errors of the Refracting convex are so far from being less, that they are more than sixteen times greater than the like errors of the Reflecting Concave, especially in great Apertures; and that without respect to the Heterogeneous constitution of light. So that, however the contrary supposition might make the Author of these Animadversions reject Reflections as useless for the promoting of Op <5086> tiques; yet I must for this as well as other considerations prefer them in the Theory before Refractions.
Whether the Parabola be more difficult to describe than the Hyperbola or Ellipsis, may be a Quære: But I see no absolute necessity of endeavouring after any of their descriptions. For, if Metals can be ground truly Spherical, they will bear as great Apertures, as I believe men will be able to communicate an exact polish to. And for Dioptrique Telescopes, I told you, that the difficulty consisted not in the Figure of the glass, but in the Difformity of Refractions: Which if it did not, I could tell you a better and more easie remedy than the use of the Conic Sections.
[4] Thus much concerning the Practique part of Optiques. I shall now take a view of the Considerations on my Theories. And those consist in ascribing an Hypothesis, which, as to the principal parts, is not against me; in Granting the greatest part of my discourse if explicated by that Hypothesis; and in Denying some things, the truth of which would have appear'd by an experimental examination.
[5] Of these Particulars I shall discourse in order. And first of the Hypothesis, which is ascribed to me in these words: But grant his first supposition, that light is a body, and that as many colours or degrees as there may be, so many bodies there may be; all of which compounded together would make White, &c. This, it seems, is taken for my Hypothesis. 'Tis true, that from my Theory I argue the Corporeity of Light; but I do it without any absolute positiveness, as the word perhaps intimates; and make it at most but a very plausible consequence of the Doctrine, and not a fundamental Supposition, nor so much as any part of it; which was wholly comprehended in the precedent Propositions. And I somewhat wonder, how the Objector could imagine, that, when I had asserted the Theory with the greatest rigour, I should be so forgetful as afterwards to assert the fundamental supposition it self with no more than a perhaps. Had I intended any such Hypothesis, I should somewhere have explain'd it. But I knew, that the Properties, which I declar'd of Light, were in <5087> some measure capable of being explicated not only by that, but by many other Mechanical Hypotheses. And therefore I chose to decline them all, and to speak of Light in general terms, considering it abstractly, as something or other propagated every way in streight lines from luminous bodies, without determining, what that Thing is; whether a confused Mixture of difform qualities, or Modes of bodies, or of Bodies themselves, or of any Virtues, Powers, or Beings whatsoever. And for the same reason I chose to speak of Colours according to the information of our Senses, as if they were Qualities of Light without us. Whereas by that Hypothesis I must have considered them rather as Modes of Sensation, excited in the mind by various motions, figures, or sizes of the corpuscles of Light, making various Mechanical impressions on the Organ of Sense; as I expressed it in that place, where I spake of the Corporeity of Light.
But supposing I had propounded that Hypothesis, I understand not, why the Objector should so much endeavour to oppose it. For certainly it has a much greater affinity with his own Hypothesis, than he seems to be aware of; the Vibrations of the Æther being as useful and necessary in this, as in his. For, assuming the Rays of Light to be small bodies, emitted every way from Shining substances, those, when they impinge on any Refracting or Reflecting superficies, must as necessarily excite Vibrations in the æther, as Stones do in water when thrown into it. And supposing these Vibrations to be of several depths or thicknesses, accordingly as they are excited by the said corpuscular rays of various sizes and velocities; of what use they will be for explicating the manner of Reflection and Refraction, the production of Heat by the Sun-beams, the Emission of Light from burning putrifying, or other substances, whose parts are vehemently agitated, the Phænomena of thin transparent Plates and Bubles, and of all Natural bodies, the Manner of Vision, and the Difference of Colors, as also their Harmony and Discord; I shall leave to their consideration, who may think it worth their endeavor to apply this Hypothesis to the solution of phænomena.
<5088>
[6] In the second place, I told you, that the Objectors Hypothesis, as to the fundamental part of it, is not against me. That fundamental Supposition is; That the parts of bodies, when briskly agitated, do excite Vibrations in the Æther, which are propagated every way from those bodies in streight lines, and cause a Sensation of Light by beating and dashing against the bottom of the Eye, something after the manner that Vibrations in the Air cause a Sensation of Sound by beating against the Organs of Hearing. Now, the most free and natural Application of this Hypothesis to the Solution of phænomena I take to be this: That the agitated parts of bodies, according to their several sizes, figures, and motions, do excite Vibrations in the æther of various depths or bignesses, which being promiscuously propagated through that Medium to our Eyes, effect in us a Sensation of Light of a White colour; but if by any means those of unequal bignesses be separated from one another, the largest beget a Sensation of a Red colour, the least or shortest, of a deep Violet, and the intermediat ones, of intermediat colors; much after the manner that bodies, according to their several sizes, shapes, and motions, excite vibrations in the Air of various bignesses, which, according to those bignesses, make several Tones in Sound: That the largest Vibrations are best able to overcome the resistance of a Refracting superficies, and so break through it with least Refraction; whence the Vibrations of several bignesses, that is, the Rays of several Colors, which are blended together in Light, must be parted from one another by Refraction, and so cause the Phænomena of Prismes and other refracting substances: And that it depends on the thickness of a thin transparent Plate or Buble, whether a Vibration shall be reflected at its further superficies, or transmitted; so that, according to the number of vibrations, interceding the two superficies, they may be reflected or transmitted for many successive thicknesses. And since the Vibrations which make Blew and Violet, are supposed shorter than those which make Red and Yellow, they must be reflected at a less thickness of the Plate: Which is sufficient to explicate all the ordinary phænomena of those Plates or Bubles, and also of all natural bodies, <5089> whose parts are like so many fragments of such Plates.
These seem to be the most plain, genuine and necessary conditions of this Hypothesis: And they agree so justly with my Theory, that if the Animadversor think fit to apply them, he need not, on that account, apprehend a divorce from it. But yet how he will defend it from other difficulties, I know not. For, to me, the Fundamental Supposition it self seems impossible; namely, That the Waves or Vibrations of any Fluid, can, like the Rays of Light, be propagated in Streight lines, without a continual and very extravagant spreading and bending every way into the quiescent Medium, where they are terminated by it. I mistake, if there be not both Experiment and Demonstration to the contrary. And as to the other two or three Hypotheses, which he mentions, I had rather believe them subject to the like difficulties, than suspect the Animadversor should select the worst for his own.
What I have said of this, may easily be applied to all other Mechanical Hypotheses, in which Light is supposed to be caused by any Pression or Motion whatsoever, excited in the æther by the agitated parts of Luminous bodies. For, it seems impossible, that any of those Motions or Pressions can be propagated in Streight lines without the like spreading every way into the shadow'd Medium, on which they border. But yet, if any man can think it possible, he must at least allow, that those Motions or Endeavors to motion, caused in the æther by the several parts of any Lucid body that differ in size, figure, and agitation, must necessarily be unequal: Which is enough to denominate Light an Aggregat of difform rays, according to any of those Hypotheses. And if those Original inequalities may suffice to difference the Rays in Colour and Refrangibility, I see no reason why they, that adhere to any of those hypotheses, should seek for other Causes of these Effects, unless (to use the Objectors argument) they will multiply entities without necessity.
[7] The third thing to be considered is, the Condition of the Animadversor's Concessions, which is, that I would explicate my Theories by his Hypothesis: And if I could comply with him in that point, <5090> there would be little or no difference between Us. For he grants, that without any respect to a different Incidence of rays there are different Refractions; but he would have it explicated, not by the different Refrangibility of several Rays, but by the Splitting and Rarefying of æthereal pulses. He grants my third, fourth and sixth Propositions; the sense of which is, That Un-compounded Colors are unchangeable, and that Compounded ones are changeable only by resolving them into the colors, of which they are compounded; and that all the Changes, which can be wrought in Colours, are effected only by variously mixing or parting them: But he grants them on condition that I will explicate Colors by the two sides of a split pulse, and so make but two species of them, accounting all other Colors in the world to be but various degrees and dilutings of those two. And he further grants, that Whitenesse is produced by the Convention of all Colors; but then I must allow it to be not only by Mixture of those Colors, but by a farther Uniting of the parts of the Ray supposed to be formerly split.
If I would proceed to examine these his Explications, I think it would be no difficult matter to shew, that they are not only insufficient, but in some respects to me (at least) un-intelligible. For, though it be easie to conceive, how Motion may be dilated and spread, or how parallel motions may become diverging; yet I understand not, by what artifice any Linear motion can by a refracting superficies be infinitely dilated and rarefied, so as to become Superficial: Or, if that be supposed, yet I understand as little, why it should be split at so small an angle only, and not rather spread and dispersed through the whole angle of Refraction. And further, though I can easily imagine, how Unlike motions may cross one another; yet I cannot well conceive, how they should coalesce into one uniform motion, and then part again, and recover their former Unlikeness; notwithstanding that I conjecture the ways, by which the Animadversor may endeavour to explain it. So that the Direct, uniform and undisturbed Pulses should be split and disturbed by Refraction; and yet the Oblique and disturbed Pulses persist without splitting or further disturbance by following Refractions, is (to me) as unintelligible. And there is <5091> as great a difficulty in the Number of Colours; as you will see hereafter.
[8] But whatever be the advantages or disadvantages of this Hypothesis, I hope I may be excused from taking it up, since I do not think it needful to explicate my Doctrine by any Hypothesis at all. For if Light be consider'd abstractly without respect to any Hypothesis, I can as easily conceive, that the several parts of a shining body may emit rays of differing colours and other qualities, of all which Light is constituted, as that the several parts of a false or uneven string, or of uneavenly agitated water in a Brook or Cataract, or the several Pipes of an Organ inspired all at once, or all the variety of Sounding bodies in the world together, should produce sounds of several Tones, and propagate them through the Air confusedly intermixt. And, if there were any natural bodies that could reflect sounds of one tone, and stifle or transmit those of another; then, as the Echo of a confused Aggregat of all Tones would be that particular Tone, which the Echoing body is disposed to reflect; so, since (even by the Animadversor's concessions) there are bodies apt to reflect rays of one colour, and stifle or transmit those of another; I can as easily conceive, that those bodies, when illuminated by a mixture of all colours, must appear of that colour only which they reflect.
But when the Objector would insinuate a difficulty in these things, by alluding to Sounds in the string of a Musical instrument before percussion, or in the Air of an Organ Bellowes before its arrival at the Pipes; I must confess, I understand it as little, as if one had spoken of Light in a piece of Wood before it be set on fire, or in the oyl of a Lamp before it ascend up the match to feed the flame.
[9] You see therefore, how much it is besides the business in hand, to dispute about Hypotheses. For which reason I shall now in the last place, proceed to abstract the difficulties in the Animadversor's discourse, and, without having regard to any Hypothesis, consider them in general terms. And they may be reduced to these 3 Quæres:
<5092>
1. Whether the unequal Refractions, made without respect to any inequality of incidence, be caused by the different Refrangibility of several Rays; or by the splitting, breaking or dissipating the same Ray into diverging parts?
2. Whether there be more than two sorts of Colours?
3. Whether Whiteness be a mixture of all Colours?
[10] The First of these Quæres you may find already determin'd by an Experiment in my former Letter; the design of which was to shew, That the length of the colour'd Image proceeded not from any unevenness in the Glass, or any other contingent Irregularity in the Refractions. Amongst other Irregularities I know not, what is more obvious to suspect, than a fortuitous dilating and spreading of Light after some such manner, as Des-Cartes hath described in his Æthereal Refractions for explicating the Tayle of a Comet; or as the Animadversor now supposes to be effected by the Splitting and Rarifying of his Æthereal pulses. And to prevent the suspicion of any such Irregularities, I told you, that I refracted the Light contrary ways with two Prismes successively, to destroy thereby the Regular effects of the first Prisme by the second, and to discover the Irregular effects by augmenting them with the iterated refractions. Now, amongst other Irregularities, if the first Prisme had spread and dissipated every ray into an indefinit number of diverging parts, the second should in like manner have spread and dissipated every one of those parts into a further indefinite number, whereby the Image would have been still more dilated, contrary to the event. And this ought to have hapned, because those Linear diverging parts depend not on one another for the manner of their Refraction, but are every one of them as truly and compleatly Rays as the whole was before its Incidence; as may appear by intercepting them severally.
The reasonableness of this proceeding will perhaps better appear by acquainting you with this further circumstance. I sometimes placed the second Prisme in a position Transverse to the first, on design to try, if it would make the long Image become four-sqaure by refractions crossing those that had drawn the round Image into a long one. For, if amongst other Irregularities the Refraction of the first Prisme, did by Splitting <5093> dilate a Linear ray into a Superficial, the Cross refractions of that second Prisme ought by further splitting to dilate and draw that Superficial ray into a Pyramidal solid. But, upon tryal, I found it otherwise; the Image bring as regularly Oblong as before, and inclin'd to both the Prismes at an angle of 45. degrees.
I tryed also all other Positions for the second Prisme, by turning the Ends about its middle part; and in no case could observe any such Irregularity. The Image was ever alike inclined to both Prismes, its Breadth answering to the Suns Diameter, and its length being greater or less accordingly as the Refractions more or less agreed, or contradicted one another.
And by these Observations, since the Breadth of the Image was not augmented by the Cross refraction of the second Prisme, that refraction must have been perform'd without any splitting or dilating of the ray; and therefore at least the Light incident on that Prisme must be granted an Aggregat of Rays unequally refrangible in my sense. And since the Image was equally inclin'd to both Prismes, and consequently the Refractions alike in both, it argues, that they were perform'd according to some Constant Law without any irregularity.
[11] To determine the second Quære, the Animadversor referrs to an Experiment made with two Wedge-like boxes, recited in the Micrography of the Ingenious Mr. Hook Observ. 10. pag. 73. the design of which was to produce all Colours out of a mixture of two. But there is, I conceive, a double defect in this instance. For, it appears not, that by this Experiment all colours can be produced out of two; and, if they could, yet the Inference would not follow.
That all Colours cannot by that Experiment be produced out of two, will appear by considering, that the Tincture of Aloes, which afforded one of those Colours, was not all over of one uniform colour, but appear'd yellow near the edge of the Box, and red at other places where it was thicker: affording all variety of colours from a pale yellow to a deep red or Scarlet, according to the various thickness of the liquor. And so the <5094> solution of Copper, which afforded the other colour, was of various Blews and Indigo's. So that instead of two colours, here is a great variety made use of for the production of all others. Thus, for instance, to produce all sorts of Greens, the several degrees of Yellow and pale Blew must be mixed; but to compound Purples, the Scarlet and deep Blew are to be the Ingredients.
Now, if the Animadversor contend, that all the Reds and Yellows of the one Liquor, or Blews and Indigo's of the other, are divers colours, that is a Begging of the Question: And I should as soon grant, that the two Thirds or Sixths in Musick are but several degrees of the same sound, and not divers sounds. Certainly it is much better to believe our Senses, informing us, that Red and yellow are divers colours, and to make it a Philosophical Quære, Why the same Liquor doth, according to its various thickness, appear of those divers colours, than to suppose them to be the same colour because exhibited by the same liquor? For, if that were a sufficient reason, then Blew and Yellow must also be the same colour, since they are both exhibited by the same Tincture of Nephritick Wood. But that they are divers colours, you will more fully understand by the reason, which, in my Judgment, is this: The Tincture of Aloes is qualified to transmit most easily the rays indued with red, most difficultly the rays indued with violet, and with intermediat degrees of facility the rays indued with intermediat colours. So that where the liquor is very thin, it may suffice to intercept most of the violet, and yet transmit most of the other colours; all which together must compound a middle Colour, that is, a faint yellow. And where it is so much thicker as also to intercept most of the Blew and Green, the remaining Green, Yellow, and Red, it must compound an Orenge. And where the thickness is so great, that scarce any rays can pass through it besides those indued with Red, must appear of that colour, and that so much the deeper and obscurer, by how the liquor is thicker. And the same may be understood of the various degrees of Blew, exhibited by the Solution of Copper, by reason of its disposition to intecept Red most easily, and transmit a deep Blew or Indigo Colour most freely.
<5095>
But, supposing that all Colours might, according to this experiment, be produced out of two by mixture; yet it follows not, that those two are the only Original colours, and that for a double reason. First, because those two are not themselves Original colours, but compounded of others; there being no liquor nor any other body in nature, whose colour in Day-light is wholly un-compounded. And then, because, though those two were Original, and all others might be compounded of them, yet it follows not, that they cannot be otherwise produced. For I said, that they had a double Origin, the same Colours to sense being in some cases compounded and in others un compounded; and sufficiently declar'd in my third and fourth Propositions, and in the Conclusion, by what Properties the one might be known and distinguish't from the other. But, because I suspect by some Circumstances, that the Distinction might not be rightly apprehended, I shall once more declare it, and further explain it by Examples.
That Colour is Primary or Original, which cannot by any Art be changed, and whose Rays are not alike refrangible: And that Compounded, which is changeable into other colours, and whose Rays are not alike refrangible. For instance, to know, whether the colour of any Green object be compounded or not, view it through a Prisme, and if it appear confused, and the edges tinged with Blew, Yellow, or any variety of other colours, then is that Green compounded of such colours as at its edges emerge out of it: But if it appear distinct, and well defin'd, and entirely Green to the very edges, without any other colours emerging, it is of an Original and un-compounded Green. In like manner, if a refracted beam of light, being cast on a white wall, exhibit a Green colour, to know whether that be compounded, refract the beam with an interposed Prisme; and if you find any Difformity in the refractions, and the Green be transform'd into Blew, Yellow, or any variety of other colours, you may conclude, that it was compounded of those which emerge: But if the Refractions be uniform, and the Green persist without any change of colour, then it is Original and un compounded. And the reason why I call it so, is, because a Green indued with such properties cannot be produced by any mixing of other colours.
<5096>
Now, if two Green Objects may to the naked eye appear of the same colour, and yet one of them through a prisme seem confused and variegated with other colours at the edges, and the other distinct and entirely Green; or, if there may be two Beams of Light, which falling on a white wall do to the naked eye exhibit the same Green colour, and yet one of them, when transmitted through a Prisme, be uniformly and regularly refracted, and retain its colour unchanged, and the other be irregularly refracted and to divaricate into a multitude of other colours; I suppose, these two greens will in both cases be granted of a different Origin and constitution. And if by mixing colours, a green cannot be compounded with the properties of the Unchangeable Green, I think, I may call that an Un-compounded colour, especially since its rays are alike refrangible, and uniform in all respects.
The same rule is to be observ'd in examining, whether Red, Orenge, Yellow, Blew, or any other colour be compounded or not. And, by the way, since all White objects through the Prisme appear confus'd and terminated with colours, Whiteness must, according to this distinction, be ever compounded, and that the most of all colours, because it is the most confus'd and changed by Refractions.
From hence I may take occasion to communicate a way for the improvement of Microscopes by Refraction. The way is, by illuminating the Object in a darkned room with Light of any convenient colour not too much compounded: for by that means the Microscope will with distinctness bear a deeper Charge and larger Aperture, especially if its construction be such, as I may hereafter describe; for, the advantage in Ordinary Microscopes will not be so sensible.
[12] There remains now the third Quære to be consider'd, which is, Whether Whiteness be an Uniform Colour, or a dissimilar Mixture of all colours? The Experiment which I brought to decide it, the Animadversor thinks may be otherwise explain'd, and so concludes nothing. But he might easily have satisfied himself by trying, what would be the result of a Mixture of all colours. And that very Experiment might have satisfied him, if he had pleased to examine it by <5097> the various circumstances. One circumstance I there declared, of which I see no notice taken; and it is, That if any colour at the Lens be intercepted, the Whiteness will be changed into the other colours: If all the colours but red be intercepted, that Red alone in the concourse or crossing of the Rays will not constitute Whiteness, but continues as much Red as before; and so of the other colours. So that the business is not only to shew, how rays, which before the concourse exhibit colours, do in the concourse exhibit White; but to shew, How in the same place, where the several sorts of rays apart exhibit several colours, a Confusion of all together make White. For instance, if red alone be first transmitted to the paper at the place of concourse, and then the other colours be let fall on that Red, the Question will be, Whether they convert it into White, by mixing with it only, as Blew falling on Yellow light is suppos'd to compound Green; or, Whether there be some further change wrought in the colours by their mutual acting on one another, untill, like the contrary Peripatetic qualities, they become assimilated. And he that shall explicate this last Case mechanically, must conquer a double impossibility. He must first shew, that many unlike motions in a Fluid can by clashing so act on one another, and change each other, as to become one Uniform motion; and then, that an Uniform motion can of itself, without any new unequal impressions, depart into a great variety of motions regularly un-equal. And after this he must further tell me, Why all Objects appear not of the same colour, that is, why their colours in the Air, where the rays that convey them every way are confusedly mixt, do not assimilate one another and become Uniform before they arrive at the Spectators eye?
But if there be yet any doubting, 'tis better to put the Event on further Circumstances of the Experiment, than to acquiesce in the possibility of any Hypothetical Explication. As, for instance, by trying, What will be the apparition of these colours in a very quick Consecution of one another. And this may be easily perform'd by the rapid gyration of a Wheel with many Spoaks or coggs in its perimeter, whose Interstices and thicknesses may be equal and of such a largeness, that, if the Wheel be interposed between the Prisme and the white concourse <5098> of the colours, one half of the Colours may be intercepted by a spoake or cogg, and the other half pass through an interstice. The Wheel being in this posture, you may first turn it slowly about, to see all the colours fall successively on the same place of the paper, held at their aforesaid concourse; and if you then accelerate its gyration, until the Consecution of those colours be so quick, that you cannot distinguish them severally, the resulting colour will be a Whiteness perfectly like that, which an un-refracted beam of Light exhibits, when in like manner successively interrupted by the spoaks or coggs of that circulating Wheel. And that this Whiteness is produced by a successive Intermixture of the Colours, without their being assimilated, or reduc'd to any Uniformity, is certainly beyond all doubt, unless things that exist not at the same time may notwithstanding act on one another.
There are yet other Circumstances, by which the Truth might have been decided; as by viewing the White concourse of the Colours through another Prisme plac'd close to the eye, by whose Refraction that whiteness may appear again transform'd into Colours: And then, to examine their Origin, if an Assistant intercept any of the colours at the Lens before their arrival at the Whiteness, the same colours will vanish from amongst those, into which that Whiteness is converted by the second Prisme. Now, if the rays which disappear be the same with those that are intercepted, then it must be acknowledged, that the second Prisme makes no new colours in any rays, which were not in them before their concourse at the paper. Which is a plain indication, that the rays of several colours remain distinct from one another in the Whiteness, and that from their previous dispositions are deriv'd the Colours of the second Prisme. And, by the way, what is said of their Colors may be applied to their Refrangibility.
The aforesaid Wheel may be also here made use of; and, if its gyration be neither too quick nor too slow, the succession of the colours may be discern'd through the Prisme, whilst to the naked eye of a Bystander they exhibit whiteness.
There is something still remaining to be said of this Experi <5099> ment. But this, I conceive, is enough to enforce it, and so to decide the controversy. How-ever, I shall now proceed to shew some other ways of producing Whiteness by mixtures, since I perswade my self, that this Assertion above the rest appears Paradoxical, and is with most difficulty admitted. And because the Animadversor desires an instance of it in Bodies of divers colours, I shall begin with that. But in order thereto it must be consider'd, that such colour'd Bodies reflect but some part of the Light incident on them; as is evident by the 13 Proposition: And therefore the Light reflected from an Aggregat of them will be much weakned by the loss of many rays. Whence a perfect and intense Whiteness is not to be expected, but rather a Colour between those of Light and Shadow, or such a Gray or Dirty colour as may be made by mixing White and Black together.
And that such a Colour will result, may be collected from the colour of Dust found in every corner of an house, which hath been observ'd to consist of many colour'd particles. There may be also produced the like Dirty colour by mixing several Painters colours together. And the same may be effected by Painting a Top (such as Boys play with) of divers colours. For, when it is made to circulate by whipping it, it will appear of such a dirty colour.
Now, the Compounding of these colours is proper to my purpose, because they differ not from Whiteness in the Species of colour, but only in degree of Luminousness: which (did not the Animadversor concede it) I might thus evince. A beam of the Suns Light being transmitted into a darkned room, if you illuminate a sheet of White Paper by that Light, reflected from a body of any colour, the paper wil always appear of the colour of that body, by whose reflected light it is illuminated. If it be a red body, the paper will be red; if a green body, it will be green; and so of the other colours. The reason is, that the fibers or threads, of which the paper consists, are all transparent and specular; and such substances are known to reflect colours without changing them. To know therefore, to what Species of colour a Grey belongs, place any Gray body (suppose a Mixture of Painters colours,) in the said Light, and the paper, being illuminated by its reflexion, shall appear White. And the same thing will happen, if it be illuminated by reflexion from a black substance.
These therefore are all of one Species; but yet they seem distinguisht not only by degrees of Luminousness, but also by some other Inequalities, whereby they become more harsh or pleasant. And the distinction seems to be, that Greys and perhaps Blacks are made by an uneven defect of Light, consisting as it were of many little veins or streams, which differ either in Luminousness or in the Unequal di <5100> stribution of diversly colour'd rays; such as ought to be caus'd by Reflexion from a Mixture of white and black, or of diversly color'd corpuscles. But when such imperfectly mixt Light is by a second Reflexion from the paper more evenly and uniformly blended, it becomes more pleasant, and exhibits a faint or shadow'd Whiteness. And that such little irregularities as these may cause these differences, is not improbable, if we consider, how much variety may be caused in Sounds of the same tone by irregular and uneven jarrings. And besides, these differences are so little, that I have sometimes doubted, whether they be any at all, when I have consider'd that a Black and White Body being plac'd together, the one in a strong light, and the other in a very faint light, so proportion'd that they might appear equally luminous; it has been difficult to distinguish them, when view'd at distance, unless when the Black seem'd more blewish; and the White body in a light still fainter, hath, in comparison of the Black body, it self appear'd Black.
This leads me to another way of Compounding Whiteness; which is, That, if four or five Bodies of the more eminent colours, or a Paper painted all over, in several parts of it, with those several colours in a due proportion, be placed in the said Beam of Light; the Light, reflected from those Colours to another White paper, held at a convenient distance, shall make that paper appear White. If it be held too near the Colours, its parts will seem of those colours that are nearest them; but by removing it further, that all its parts may be equally illuminated by all the colours, they will be more and more diluted, until they become perfectly White. And you may further observe, that if any of the colours be intercepted, the Paper will no longer appear White, but of the other colours which are not intercepted. Now, that this Whiteness is a Mixture of the severally colour'd rays, falling confusedly on the paper, I see no reason to doubt of; because, if the Light became Uniform and Similar before it fell confusedly on the paper, it must much more be Uniform, when at a greater distance it falls on the Spectators eye, and so the rays, which come from several colours, would in no qualities differ from one another, but all of them exhibit the same colour to the Spectator, contrary to what he sees.  
Not much unlike this Instance it is, That, if a polisht piece of Metal be so placed, that the colours appear in it as in a Looking-glass, and then the Metal be made rough, that by a confus'd reflexion those apparent colours may be blended together, they shall disappear, and by their mixture cause the Metall to look White.
<5101>
But further to enforce this Experiment; if, instead ot the Paper, any White Froth, consisting of small bubles, be illuminated by reflexion from the aforesaid Colours, it shall to the naked eye seem White, and yet through a good Microscope the several Colours will appear distinct on the bubles, as if seen by reflexion from so many spherical surfaces. With my naked eye, being very near, I have also discern'd the several colours on each buble; and yet at a greater distance, where I could not distinguish them apart, the Froth hath appear'd entirely White. And at the same distance, when I look'd intently, I have seen the colours distinctly on each buble; and yet, by straining my eyes as if I would look at something far off beyond them, thereby to render the Vision confus'd, the Froth has appear'd without any other colour than Whiteness. And what is here said of Froths, may easily be understood of the Paper or Metal in the foregoing Experiments. For, their parts are specular bodies, like these Bubles: And perhaps with an excellent Microscope the Colours may be also seen intermixedly reflected from them.
In proportioning the severally Colour'd bodies to produce these effects, there may be some niceness; and it will be more convenient, to make use of the colours of the Prisme, cast on a Wall, by whose reflexion the Paper, Metal, Froth, and other White substances may be illuminated. And I usually made my Tryals this way, because I could better exclude any scattering Light from mixing with the colours to dilate them.
To this way of Compounding Whiteness may be referr'd that other, by Mixing light after it hath been trajected through transparently colour'd substances. For instance, if no Light be admitted into a room but only through Colour'd glass, whose several parts are of several colours in a pretty equal proportion; all White things in the room shall appear White, if they be not held too near the Glass. And yet this light, with which they are illuminated, cannot possibly be uniform, because, if the Rays, which at their entrance are of divers colours, do in their progress through the room suffer any alteration to be reduced to an Uniformity; the Glass would not in the remotest parts of the room appear of the very same colour, which it doth when the Spectators eye is very near it: Nor would the rays, when transmitted into another dark room through a little hole in an opposite door or partition-wall, project on a Paper the Species or representation of the glass in its proper colours.
And, by the by, this seems a very fit and cogent Instance of some other parts of my Theory, and particularly of the 13 Proposition. For, in this room all natural Bodies whatever appear in their proper colours. And all the Phænomena of colours in nature, made either by Refraction or without it, are here the same as in the Open Air. Now, the Light in this room being such a Dissimilar mixture, as <5102> I have described in my Theory, the Causes of all these Phænomena must be the same that I have there assign'd. And I see no reason to suspect, that the same Phænomena should have other causes in the Open Air.
The success of this Experiment may be easily conjectur'd by the appearances of things in a Church or Chappel, whose windores are of colour'd glass; or in the Open Air, when it is illustrated with Clouds of various colours.
There are yet other ways, by which I have produced Whiteness; as by casting several Colours from two or more Prismes upon the same place; by Refracting a Beam of Light with two or three Prismes successively, to make the diverging colours converge again; by Reflecting one colour to another; and by looking through a Prisme on an Object of many colours; and, (which is equivalent to the above mention'd way of mixing colours by concave Wedges fill'd with colour'd liquors,) I have observ'd the shadows of a painted Glass-window to become White, where those of many colours have at a great distance interfered. But yet, for further satisfaction, the Animadversor may try, if he please, the effects of four or five of such Wedges filled with liquors of as many several colours.
Besides all these, the Colours of Water-bubbles and other thin pellucid substances afford several instances of Whiteness produced by their mixture; with one of which I shall conclude this particular. Let some Water, in which a convenient quantity of Soap or wash ball is dissolv'd, be agitated into Froth, and, after that froth has stood a while without further agitation, till you see the bubbles, of which it consists, begin to break, there will appear a great variety of colours all over the top of every bubble, if you view them near at hand; but, if you view them at so great a distance that you cannot distinguish the colours one from another, the Froth will appear perfectly White.
[13] Thus much concerning the design and substance of the Animadversor's Considerations. There are yet some particulars to be taken notice of, before I conclude; as the denyal of the Experimentum Crucis. On this I chose to lay the whole stress of my discourse; which therefore was the principal thing to have been objected against. But I cannot be convinced of its insufficency by a bare denyal without assigning a Reason for it. I am apt to believe, it has been misunderstood; for otherwise it would have prevented the discourses about Rarifying and Splitting of rays; because the design of it is, to shew, that Rays of divers colours, consider'd a part, do at Equal Incidences suffer Unequal Refractions, without being split, rarified, or any way dilated.
<5103>
[14] In the Considerations of my first and second Propostions, the Animadversor hath rendered my Doctrine of Un-equal Refrangibility very imperfect and maimed, by explicating it wholly by the Splitting of rays; whereas I chiefly intended it in those Refractions that are perform'd without that suppos'd Irregularity; such as the Experimentum Crucis might have inform'd him of. And, in general I find, that, whilst he hath endeavour'd to explicate my Propositions Hypothetically, the more material suggestions, by which I design'd to recommend them, have escap'd his consideration; such as are, the Unchangeableness of the degree of Refrangibility peculiar to any sort of rays; the strict Analogy between the degrees of Refrangibility and Colours; the Distinction between compounded and un-compounded colours; the Unchangeableness of un-compounded colours; and the Assertion, that if any one of the Prismatique colours be wholly intercepted, that colour cannot be new produced out of the remaining Light by any further Refraction of Reflexion whatsoever. And of what strength and efficacy these Particulars are for enforcing the Theory, I desire therefore may be now consider'd.

Copy of an extract from Newton to John Collins, dated 10 December 1672

Extract of Mr Newtons Letter  to M. Collins. Dec. 10. 1672.
I am heartily glad at the acceptance, which D. Barrow's Lectures finds with forrein Mathematicians; and it pleased me not a little to understand that they are falne into the same method of drawing Tangents with me. What I guess their method to be, you will apprehend by this example;
Suppose  applied to  in any given angle be terminated at any Curve line , and calling   and  , let the relation between  and  be exprest by any æquation; as , whereby the Curve is determined. To draw the Tangent , the Rule is this. Multiply the termes of the æquation by any Arithmetical progression according to the dimensions of , suppose thus ; also according to the dimensions of  suppose thus . The first product shall be the Numerator, and the last divided by  the Denominator of a fraction which expresses the length of , to whose end  the tangent  must be drawn. The length  therefore is .
This is one particular, or rather a Corollary of a general Method which extends itself, without any troublesome calculation, not only to the drawing tangents to all Curve lines, whether Geometric, or Mechanic, or however related to streight lines or to other Curve lines, but also to the resolving other abstruser kinds of problems about the crookedness, areas, lengths, centers of gravity of curves &c. Nor is it (as Huddens method de maximis et minimis, and consequently Slusius his new method of Tangents, as I presume,) limited to æquations which are free from surd quantities. This method I have interwoven with that other of working in æquations by reducing them to infinit series. I remember, I once occasionally told Dr Barrow, when he was about to publish his Lectures, that I had such a method of drawing Tangents, but some divertisemt or other hindered me from describing it to him.
Of resolving by Cardans rules Æquations that have 3 possible roots, there may be examples framed at pleasure; but unless Brasser show a direct method of performing it, which Ferguson dos not, it will not be allowed scientific. How it is to be done directly, I may possibly show upon occasion.

Ex eadem {epta} Newtoni ad Collinium  d. 10. Dec. 1672.
Mr Gregory is pleased to consider further the most advantageous construction of Cata-dioptrical Telescopes. And as his dessein in his Optica promota excels that of M. Cassegrain (though they differ so slightly, that I thought it not worth the while to take notice of the difference,) the advantage being, that the little concave Ellipsis comes nearer to a Spherical figure, than the Convex Hyperbola; so I conceive his present proposall excells them both, of making that speculum plane. And this I conjecture is the way, which Signor Salvetti, one of the Great Dukes Musicians, mentioned in the last Transactions, intends to make Experiment of, excepting that instead of the Convex Ey-glas glass he may probably substitut a Concave one to erect the object. But yet I cannot think it the best, it being liable to the first, third and last of those difficulties, I urged against M. Cassegrain, and in my Judgement not wholly capable of the advantages, which M. Gregory propounds. The first disadvantage was, that more light is lost in direct than oblique reflection. I am convinced by several ObservationsObservations, that reflexion is not made by the solid parts of a body, (as is commonly presumed,) but by the confine of the two mediums, whereof one is within, and the other without the body. And as stones are reflected by water, when thrown obliquely, which force their way into it when thrown directly downwards; so the rays of Light (whether Corporeal like stones, or not,) are most easily and copiously reflected when incident most obliquely. This you may observe in the passage of Light out of Glass into Air, which is reflected more and more copiously, as the obliquity is increased, untill beyond a certain degree of obliquity it be wholly reflected. Also in the reflexion of Light by an imperfectly polishet plate of Brass or Silver or any other metall, you may observe that the Images of objects, which by direct reflexion appear dull and confused, appear by very oblique reflexion pretty distinct and vigorous. This advantage of oblique reflexion would be inconsiderable, if metall reflected almost all the light directly incident on it, but so far as I can observe, there is at least a third part, if not the better half, of the light lost and stifled in the metal at every reflexion; and it is of some estimation if a third or fourth part of that can be redeemed by setting the flat speculum obliquely. As for Mr Gregory's insinuation, that direct rays have the advantage of oblique, because a direct ball is reflected more regularly from a rough wall, than an oblique one; if he please to consider, how different are the causes and circumstances of those reflexions, possibly upon second thoughts he may apprehend, why the contrary ought to happen in Light, at least the Experiment of the rudely polishet plate of metall may persuade him.
The next dis-advantage arising from the distance of the litle speculum from the Ey-glass, being allowed, I pass to the last, which is to this effect; That; if <43v> to diminish the magnifying virtue of the instrument the litle speculum be made of a larger sphere, (as it is in M. Gregory's dessein, a plane being equivalent to a sphere whose center is indefinitly distant,) that would cause too many of the best rays to be intercepted. And tho in his designe scarce a forth part of the whole light be intercepted, yet those rays seem to me of more value than twice their number next the circumference of the; Tube, because they principally conduce to distinct vision. Their loss will be judged considerable by those, that have thought the loss of scarce the fortieth part of the Light in my way worthy of being objected by reason that they were the best of the rays.
There are yet other Considerations, by which Mr Gregory's Tube may perhaps be thought less advantagious, as, that unles the speculum  be made so broad as to intercept more than a quarter, or perhaps than a third part of the whole Light, it will be difficult to enlarge the aperture as is requisite for viewing dull and obscure objects. That the Ey-glas, if placed at the bottom, will scarcely be well defended from the unusefull glaring light which in the day-time comes from objects on all sides the flat speculum, at least not so well as by setting it at the side: And that an Artificer can scarcely polish the great Concave so truly when perforated in the midle; for the metal near that hole will be apt to weare away too fast, as it doth near the exterior limb. And tho the hole may be made after it is polishet, yet if the figure happen to be less true, or if afterwards the metal chance to tarnish, it must be polishet again.
As for the Advantages propounded by M. Gregory, I see not, why the first should be reckoned for one, viz. That the distance  grows almost the one half less, and therefore the Errors of the Concave  are also diminishet upon the plane  by one half. For, how much those Errors of the Concave  are increased or diminished is to be estimated by the prevarication of the rays not at the plane , but at the focus of that concave . And there the Errors in both cases will be alike, provided the speculum  be accurately plane; but if there be any irregularities in the figure of that Speculum , they will cause Errors so much greater in one case than in the other, as that speculum is remoter from the Ey-glass; which in large Telescopes may be more than  or  times.
The other Advantage, viz. That his Tube will be litle more than half the length of mine, I should allow to be very considerable, i{f} {I} thought, that with equall art in the mechanisme it could be made to doe the same effect. The greatest difficulty is in forming the great Concave, which when once well done, perhaps it may be thought most advantagious, to make the best use of it with a longer Tube.
The supposed Advantage of Telescopes with Convex or Concave speculums in that they may have any desirable charge by altering the distances of the Ey-glass and specula, agrees more conveniontly <42r> dessein of the Instrument if that speculum be made use of, which I described in a letter to M. Oldenburg in answer to M. Auzouts Considerations on these Instruments, which possibly you may have seen. For instance, to double the charge, the Ey-glass in the other way must be drawn out almost as far behind the great concave as the litle speculum is before it, whereby the length of the Tube will be almost doubled; whereas in my way it need be drawn out no farther from the side of the Tube than a quarter of the Tube's diameter. The charge may be also conveniently varied by having 2 or 3 Ey-glasses of severall depths set in a girdle; any of which may be adjusted to the metal , by sliding that girdle about the Tube or by sliding the ring within the Tube, to which that metal  is fastned.
That Telescopes by Convex or concave speculums should be overcharged is not necessary; but yet it is not avoidable without running upon one of the other two inconveniences, described in the seventh particular of my considerations on M. Cassegrains Tube, as I there intimated.
To diminish some of the aforesaid disadvantages, there may be still new variations or additions to these designes. As, for instance, by using two Ey-glasses. Suppose  represent the great Concave,  the litle Speculum,  the Ey-glas and  another double  Convex-glas between  and  on both sides of which the rays crosse. This way of redoubling these Tubes seems not inferior to the rest: for, thus the object appears erect, the speculum  intercepts less light, and the charge may be varied at pleasure, only by changing the positions of  and . But yet this is not without its imperfections, and particularly (besides those common with the other designs,) the glass  will intercept many of the best rays in their passage from the Concave  to the litle speculum , unless it be made less than is consistent with some other conveniences. And by the iterated decussations of the rays, objects will be rendred less distinct, as is manifest in Dioptric Telescopes, where 2 or 3 Ey-glasses are applyed to erect the object.
As to the attempt in which Mr Reeves was imployed, I presumed, it had been done with much more accuratness than Mr Gregory now signifyes, because Mr Hook, who you know is a curious and accurate Experimenter, affirms in his considerations on my letter to M. Oldenburg concerning refractions & colors, publishet in the Transactions No 80, that he made several Experiments with that Instrument. And though he lays the blame on M. Reeve's Encheiria, yet he says not, that he blamed him then; when the Experiment was made. His words are these;
"I have made many tryals both for Telescopes and Microscopes by reflexion, which I have mentioned in my Micrography, but deserted it as to Telescopes, when I considered, that then focus of a spherical Concave is not a point but a line, and that then rays are lesse true reflected to a point by <42v> a Concave, than refracted by a Convex; which made me seek that by refraction, which I found could not be expected by reflexion. Nor indeed could I find any effect of it by one of six foot radius which about 7 or {8} years since Mr Reeve made for M. Gregory with which I made severall tryals; but it now appears, that it was for want of a good encheiria; from which cause many good Experiments have been lost. Both which considerations discouraged me from attempting further that way, especially since I found the Parabola much more difficult to describe, than the Hyperbola or Ellipsis.{"}
From hence I might well infer that the want of a good Encheiria appeared not till now: And that Mr Hook was discouraged from attempting further that way only by these 2 or 3 considerations; That a Convex (as he presumes) refracts more truly, than a concave reflects; that he found no effect by one of  foot radius, which till now he attributed to some other cause then the want of a good encheiria, namly to the supposedly less true reflexion of a spherical concave; and that he apprehended a greater difficulty of describing a parabola than an Hyperbola or Ellipsis. Nor could I well interpret the cause, from which many good Experiments have been lost, to have been other than the want of a good Encheiria, which till afterwards appears not to have been wanting. I contend not, that this was M. Hooks meaning, but only that his words seemed to import thus much: which gave me occasion to think, there was no diligence wanting in making that Experiment, especially since he expresseth, that he made severall tryals with it.

And that you may not think I strained Mr Gregorys sense, where he spake of Hyperbolic and Elliptic Glasses and Speculums attempted in vain; I would aske, to what end those Speculums were attempted if not to compose optic Instruments; which is all I would inferr from those words. For, that these Instruments, if at all attempted, were attempted in vain, is evident by the want of success.
This, Sir, I have said, not that I desire to discourage the tryall of any practicable way, or to contend with Mr Gregory about so slender a difference. For, I doubt not but when he wrote his Optica promota, he could have described more fashions than one of these Telescopes and perhaps have run through all the possible cases of them, if he had thought it worth his pains. Because M. Cassegrain propounded his supposed Invention pompously, as if the main busines was in the contrivance of these Instruments, I thought fit to signify, that that was none of his contrivance, nor so advantageous as he imagined. And I have now sent you these further Considerations on M. Gregory's Answer, only to let you see, that I chose the most easy and practicable way to make the first Tryals. Others may try other ways. Nor doe I think it material, which way these Instruments are perfected, so they be perfected.

Answer to Huygens' critique of Newton's new theory of light and colours, dated 10 June 1673

Mr Newton's Letter upon his receipt of Monsieur Hugens's Book de Motu Pendulorum, together with some considerations upon it; as also an Answer to the same M. Hugens's Letter of June 10. 1673; in which Answer he further explains his New Theory of Light and Colors, and particularly that of Whiteness, etc.
< text from f 47r resumes >
Sir
< insertion from the top of f 47r > < text from f 47r resumes >
Concerning the bussiness of colours; in my saying that when M. Hugens hath shown how White may be produced out of two uncompounded colours, I will tell him why he can conclude nothing from that; my meaning was, that such a White, (were there any such,) would have different properties from the White, which I had respect to, when I described my Theory, that is, from the white of the Sun's immediate light, of the ordinary objects of our senses, & of all white Phænomena that have hitherto faln under my observation. And those different properties would evince it to be of a different constitution: Insomuch that such a production of white would be so <47v> far from contradicting, that it would rather illustrate & confirm my Theory; because by the difference of that from other whites it would appear that other whites are not compounded of onely two colours like that. And therefore if Monsieur N. would prove any thing, it is requisite that he do not onely produce out of two primitive [2]colours a white which to the naked eye shall appear like other whites, but also shall agree with them in all other properties.
But to let you understand wherein such a white would differ from other whites & why from thence it would follow that other whites are otherwise compounded, I shall lay down this position
That a compounded colour can be resolved into no more simple colours  then those of which it is compounded.
This seems to be self evident, & I have also tryed it severall ways, & particularly by this which follows: Let  represent an oblong piece  of white paper about  or  of an inch broad & illuminated in a dark room with a mixture of two colours cast upon it from two Prisms, suppose a deep blew & scarlet, which must severally be as uncompounded as they can conveniently be made. Then at a convenient distance, suppose of six or eight yards, view it through a clear triangular glass or crystall Prism held parallel to the paper & you shall see the two colours parted from one another in the fashion of two images of the paper as they are represented at  &  where suppose  the scarlet &  the blew, without green or any other colour between them.
Now from the afforesaid Position I deduce these two conclusions: 1 That if there were found out a way to compound white of two simple colours onely, that white would be again resolvable into no more then two. Secondly That if other whites (as that of the suns light &c) be resolvable into more then two simple colours (as I find by experiment that they are) then they must be compounded of more then two.
To make this plainer, suppose that  represents a white body illuminated by a direct beam of the sun transmitted through a small hole into a dark room, &  such another body illuminated by a mixture of two simple colours which if possible [3]may make it also appear of a white colour exactly like . Then at a convenient distance view these two whites through a Prism &  will be changed into a series of all colours, Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, Purple with their intermediate degrees succeeding in order from  to . But , according to the afforesaid experiment, will onely yeild those two colours of which it was compounded, & those not conterminate like the colours at  but separate from one another, as at  & , by means of the different refrangibility of the rays to which they belong. And thus by comparing these two whites, they would appear to be of a different constitution &  to consist of more colours then . So that what Monsieur N. contends for, would rather advance my Theory by the access of a new kind of white then conclude against it. But I see no hopes of compounding such a white.
As for Monsieur N. his expression that I maintain my doctrine with some concern I confess it was a little ungratefull to me to meet with objections which had been answered before, without having the least reason given me why those answers were insufficient. The answers which I speak of are in the Transactions from pag 5093 to pag 5102. And particularly in pag 5095, to show that there are other simple colours besides blew & yellow, I instance in a simple or homogeneal green such as cannot be made by mixing blew & yellow or any other colours. And there also I show why, supposing that all colours might be produced out of two, yet it would not follow that those two are the onely originall colours. The reasons I desire you would compare with what hath <47ar> been now said of white. And so the necessity of all colours to produce white might have appeared by the experiment pag 5097 where I say that if any colour at the Lens be intercepted the whiteness (which is compounded of them all) will be changed into (the result of) the other colours.
However, since there seems to have happened some misunderstanding between us, I shall indeavour to explain my self a little further in these things according to the following method.
Definitions.
1. I call that Light homogeneal, similar or uniform whose rays are equally refrangible.
2. And that heterogeneal whose rays are unequally refrangible.
Note. There are but three affections of light in which I have observed its rays to differ. viz: Refrangibility, Reflexibility & Colour, & those rays which agree in refrangibility agree also in the other two & therefore may well be defined homogeneal: especially since men usually call those things homogeneal which are so in all qualities that come under their knowledg, though in other qualities that their knowledg extends not to there may possibly be some heterogeneity.
3. Those colours I call simple, or homogeneal, which are exhibited by homogeneal light.
4{.} And those compound or heterogeneal which are exhibited by heterogeneal light.
5{.} Different colours I call not, onely the more eminent species, red, yellow, green, blew, purple, but all other the minutest gradations: much after the same manner that not onely the more eminent degrees in musick but all the least gradations are esteemed different sounds.
Propositions.
1. The Sun's light consists of rays differing by indefinite degrees of refrangibility.
2. Rays which differ in refrangibility, when parted from one another do proportionally differ in the colours which they exhibit. These two Propositions are matter of fact.
3. There are as many simple or homogeneal colours as degrees of refrangibility. For to every degree of refrangibility belongs a different colour by Proposition 2. And that colour is simple by Definition 1, & 3.
4. Whiteness in all respects like that of the Sun's immediate light & of all the usuall objects of our senses cannot be compounded of two simple colours alone. For such a composition must be made by rays that have onely two degrees of refrangibility by Definition 1, & 3.; & therefore it cannot be like that of the suns light by Proposition 1; Nor for the same reason like that of ordinary white objects.
[4]5. Whiteness in all respects like that of the Sun's immediate light cannot be compounded of simple colours, without an indefinite variety of them. For to such a composition there are requisite rays indued with all the indefinite degrees of refrangibility by Proposition 1. And those infer as many simple colours, by Definition 1 & 3. & Proposition 2 & 3{.}
To make these a little plainer, I have added also the Propositions that follow.                                
6. The rays of light do not act on one another in passing through the same Medium. This appeares by several passages in the Transactions pag. 5097, 5098, 5100, & 5101, & is capable of further proof.
7. The rays of light suffer not any change of their qualities from refraction{.}
8. Nor afterwards from the adjacent quiet Medium. These two Propositions are manifest de facto in homogeneal light, whose colour & refrangibility is not at all <47av> changeable either by refraction or by the contermination of a quiet Medium. And as for heterogeneal light, it is but an aggregate of severall sorts of homogeneal light no one sort of which suffers any more alteration then if it were alone becaus the rays act not on one another by Proposition 6. And therefore the aggregate can suffer none. These two Propositions also might be further proved apart by Experiments, too long to be here described.
9. There can no homogeneal colours be educed out of light by refraction which were not commixt in it before: Because by Proposition 7, & 8, Refraction changeth not the qualities of the rays, but onely separates those which have divers qualities, by means of their different Refrangibility{.}
10. The sun's light is an aggregate of an indefinite variety of homogeneal colours; by Proposition 1, 3, & 9. And hence it is, that I call homogeneal colours also primitive or original. And thus much concerning colours.


Monsieur N. has thought fit to insinuate that the aberration of rays (by their different refrangibility) is not so considerable a disadvantage in glasses as I seemed to be willing to make men beleive when I propounded concave mirrors as the onely hopes of perfecting Telescopes. But if he please to take his pen & compute the errors of a Glass & Speculum that [5]collect rays at equall distances, he will find how much he is mistaken, & that I have not been extravagant, as he imagins, in preferring reflexions. And as for what he says of the difficulty of the praxis I know it is very difficult, & by those ways which he attempted it I beleive it unpracticable. But there is a way insinuated in the Transactions pag. 3080 by which it is not improbable but that as much may be done in large Telescopes, as I have thereby done in short ones, but yet not without more then ordinary diligence & curiosity.

I. Newton

Hypothesis explaining the properties of light
Sir,
I have sent you the papers I mentioned, by JOHN STILES. Upon reviewing them, I find some things so obscure, as might have deserved a further explication by schemes; and some other things, I guess, will not be new to you, though almost all was new to me when I wrote them. But as they are, I hope you will accept of them, though not worth the ample thanks you sent. I remember, in some discourse with Mr. HOOKE, I happened to say, that I thought light was reflected, not by the parts of glass, water, air, or other sensible bodies; but by the same confine or superficies of the æthereal mediums, which refracts it, the rays finding some difficulty to get through it in passing out of the denser into the rarer medium, and a greater difficulty in passing out of the rarer into the denser; and so being either refracted or reflected by that superficies, as the circumstances they happened to be in at their incidence make them able or unable to get through it. And, for confirmation of this, I said further, that I thought the reflection of light, as its tending out of glass into air, would not be diminished or weakened by drawing away the air in an air-pump, as it ought to be, if they were the parts of air that reflected: and added, that I had not tried this experiment, but though he was not unacquainted with notions of this kind. To which he replied, that the notion was not new, and he would the first opportunity try the experiment I propounded. But upon reviewing the papers I send you, I found it there set down for tried; which makes me recollect, that about the time I was writing these papers, I had occasionally observed in an air-pump here at Christ's College, that I could not perceive the reflection of the inside of the glass diminished in drawing out the air. This I thought fit to mention, least my former forgetfulness, through having long laid aside my thoughts on these things, should make me seem to have set down for certain what I never tried.
<248>
Sir, I had formerly purposed never to write any hypothesis of light and colours, fearing it might be a means to engage me in vain disputes: but I hope a declared resolution to answer nothing, that looks like a controversy, unless possibly at my own time upon some by-occasion, may defend me from that fear. And therefore considering, that such an hypothesis would much illustrate the papers I promised to send you; and having a little time this last week to spare, I have not scrupled to describe one, so far as I could on a sudden recollect my thoughts about it; not concerning myself, whether it shall be thought probable or improbable, so it do but render the papers I send you, and others sent formerly, more intelligible. You may see, by the scratching and interlining, it was done in haste; and I have not had time to get it transcribed, which makes me say I reserve a liberty of adding it; and desire, that you would return those and the other papers when you have done with them. I doubt there is too much to be read at one time, but you will soon know how to order that. At the end of the hypothesis you will see a paragraph to be inserted as is there directed: I should have added another or two, but I had not time, but such as it is, I hope you will accept it.
Sir, I am, &c.
Is. NEWTON.
An Hypothesis explaining the Properties of Light, discoursed of in my several Papers.
Sir,
In my answer to Mr. HOOKE, you may remember, I had occasion to say something of hypotheses, where I gave a reason, why all allowable hypotheses in their genuine constitution should be conformable to my theories; and said of Mr. HOOKE'S hypothesis, that I took the most free and natural application of it to phænomena to be thisi[2] : that the agitated parts of bodies, according to their several sizes, figure, and motions, do excite vibrations in the æther of various depths or bignesses, which being promiscuously propagated through that medium to our eyes, effect in us a sensation of light of a white colour; but, if by any means those of unequal bignesses be separated from one another, the largest beget a sensation of a red colour; the least, or shortest, of a deep violet; and the intermediate ones, of intermediate colours: much after the manner that bodies, according to their several sizes, shapes, and motions, excite vibrations in the air of various bignesses, which, according to those bignesses, make several tones in sound, &c. I was glad to understand, as I apprehend, from Mr. HOOKE'S discourse at my last being at one of your assemblies, that he had changed his former notion of all colours being compounded of only two original ones, made by the two sides of an oblique pulse; and accommodated his hypothesis to this my suggestion of colours, like sounds, being various, according to the various bigness of the pulses. For this I take to be a more plausible hypothesis than any other described by former authors, because I see not how the colours of thin transparent plates or skins can be handsomely explained, without having recourse to æthereal pulses: but yet I <249> like another hypothesis better, which I had occasion to hint something of in the same letter in these wordsk[3] :
The hypothesis of light's being a body, had I propounded it, has a much greater affinity with the objector's own hypothesis, than he seems to be aware of; the vibrations of the æther being as useful and necessary in this as in his. For, assuming the rays of light to be small bodies emitted every way from shining substances, those, when they impinge on any refracting or reflecting superficies, must as necessarily excite vibrations in the æther, as stones do in water when thrown into it. And, supposing these vibrations to be of several depths or thicknesses, accordingly as they are excited by the said corpuscular rays of various sizes and velocities; of what use they will be for explicating the manner of reflexion and refraction; the production of heat by the sun-beams; the emission of light from burning, putrifying, or other substances, whose parts are vehemently agitated; the phænomena of thin transparent plates, and bubbles, and of all natural bodies; the manner of vision, and the difference of colours; as also their harmony and discord; I shall leave to their consideration, who may think it worth their endeavour to apply this hypothesis to the solution of phænomena.
Were I to assume an hypothesis, it should be this, if propounded more generally, so as not to determine what light is, farther than that it is something or other capable of exciting vibrations in the æther: for thus it will become so genreal and comprehensive of other hypotheses, as to leave little room for new ones to be invented. And therefore, because I have observed the heads of some great virtuosos to run much upon hypotheses, as if my discourses wanted an hypothesis to explain them by, and found, that some, when I could not make them take my meaning, when I spake of the nature of light and colours abstractedly, have readily apprehended it, when I illustrated my discourse by an hypothesis; for this reason I have here thought fit to send you a description of the circumstances of this hypothesis as much tending to the illustration of the papers I herewith send you. And though I shall not assume either this or any other hypothesis, not thinking it necessary to concern myself, whether the properties of light, discovered by me, be explained by this, or Mr. HOOKE'S, or any other hypothesis capable of explaining them; yet while I am describing this, I shall sometimes, to avoid circumlocution, and to represent it more conveniently, speak of it, as if I assumed it, and propounded it to be believed. This I though fit to express, that no man may confound this with my other discourses, or measure the certainty of one by the other, or think me obliged to answer objections against this script: for I desire to decline being involved in such troublesome and insignificant disputes.
But to proceed to the hypothesis: First, it is to be supposed therein, that there is an æthereal medium much of the same constitution with air, but far rarer, subtler, and more strongly elastic. Of the existence of this medium the motion of a pendulum in a glass exhausted of air almost as quickly as in <250> the open air, is no inconsiderable argument. But it is not to be supposed, that this medium is one uniform matter, but compounded, partly of the main phlegmatic body of æther, partly of other various æthereal spirits, much after the manner, that air is compounded of the phlegmatic body of air intermixed with various vapours and exhalations: for the electric and magnetic effluvia, and gravitating principle, seem to argue such variety. Perhaps the whole frame of nature may be nothing but various contextures of some certain æthereal spirits, or vapours, condensed as it were by precipitation, much after the manner, that vapours are condensed into water, or exhalations into grosser substances, though not so easliy condensible; and after condensation wrought into various forms; at first by the immediate hand of the Creator; and ever since by the power of nature; which, by virtue of the command, increase and multiply, become a complete imitator of the copies set her by the protoplast. Thus perhaps may all things be originated from æther.
At least, the elastic effluvia seem to instruct us, that there is something of an æthereal nature condensed in bodies. I have sometimes laid upon a table a round piece of glass about two inches broad set in a brass ring, so that the glass might be about one eighth or one sixth of an inch from the table, and the air between them inclosed on all sides by the ring, after the manner as if I had whelmed a little sieve upon the table; and then rubbing a pretty while the glass briskly with some rough and raking stuff, till some very little fragments of very thin paper, laid on the table under the glass, began to be attracted and move nimbly to and fro; after I had done rubbing the glass, the papers would continue a pretty while in various motions; sometimes leaping up to the glass and resting there a while; then leaping down and resting there; then leaping up, and perhaps down and up again, and this sometimes in lines seeming perpendicular to the table; sometimes in oblique ones; sometimes also they would leap up in one arch and down in another, divers times together, without sensibly resting between; sometimes skip in a bow from one part of the glass to another without touching the table, and sometimes hang by a corner, and turn often about very nimbly, as if they had been carried about in the midst of a whirlwind, and be otherwise variously moved, every paper with a diverse motion. And upon sliding my finger on the upper side of the glass, though neither the glass, nor inclosed air below, were moved thereby, yet would the papers, as they hung under the glass, receive some new motion, inclining this way or that way, accordingly as I moved my finger. Now, whence all these irregular motions should spring, I cannot imagine, unless from some kind of subtil matter lying condensed in the glass, and rarefied by rubbing, as water is rarefied into vapour by heat, and in that refraction diffused through the space round the glass to a great distance, and made to move and circulate variously, and accordingly to actuate the papers till it return into the glass again, and be recondensed there. And as this condensed matter by rarefaction into an æthereal wind (for by its easy penetrating and circulating through glass I esteem it æthereal) may cause these odd motions, and by condensing again may cause electrical attraction with its returning to the glass to succeed in the place of what is there continually recondensed; so may the gravitating attraction of the <251> earth be caused by the continual condensation of some other such like æthereal spirit, not of the main body of phlegmatic æther, but of something very thinly and subtilly difused through it, perhaps of an unctuous or gummy, tenacious, and springy nature, and bearing much the same relation to æther, which the vital aereal spirit, requisite for the conservation of flame and vital motions, does to air. For, if such an æthereal spirit may be condensed in fermenting or burning bodies, or otherwise coagulated in the pores of the earth and water into some kind of humid active matter, for the continual uses of nature, adhering to the sides of those pores, after the manner that vapours condense on the sides of a vessel; the vast body of the earth, which may be every where to the very center in perpetual working, may continually condense so much of this spirit, as to cause it from above to descend with great celerity for a supply; in which descent it may bear down with it the bodies it pervades with force proportional to the superficies of all their parts it acts upon; nature making a circulation by the slow ascent of as much matter out of the bowels of the earth in an aereal form, which, for a time, constitues the atmosphere; but being continually buoyed up by the new air; exhalations and vapours rising underneath, at length (some parts of the vapours, which return in rain, excepted) vanishes again into the æthereal spaces, and there perhaps in time relents, and is attenuated into its first principle: for nature is a perpetual worker, generating fluids out of solids, and solids out of fluids, fixed things out of volatile, and volatile out of fixed, subtil out of gross and gross out of subtil; some things to ascend, and make the upper terrestrial juices, rivers, and the atmosphere; and by consequence, others to descend for a requital to the former. And, as the earth, so perhaps may the sun imbibe this spirit copiously, to conserve his shining, and keep the planets from receding further from him. And they, that will, may also suppose, that this spirit affords or carries with it thither the solary fewel and material principle of light: and that the vast æthereal spaces between us and the stars are for a sufficient repository for this food of the sun and planets. But this of the constitution of æthereal natures by the by.
In the second place, it is to be supposed, that the æther is a vibrating medium like air, only the vibrations far more swift and minute; those of air, made by a man's ordinary voice, succeeding one another at more than half a foot or a foot distance; but those of æther at a less distance than the hundred thousandth part of an inch. And, as in air the vibrations are some larger than others, but yet all equally swift (for in a ring of bells the sound of every tone is heard at two or three miles distance, in the same order that the bells are struck;) so, I suppose, the æthereal vibrations differ in bigness, but not in swiftness. Now, these vibrations, beside their use in reflexion and refraction, may be supposed the chief means, by which the parts of fermenting or putrifying substances, fluid liquors, or melted, burning, or other hot bodies, continue in motion, are shaken asunder like a ship by waves, and dissipated into vapours, exhalations, or smoke, and light loosed or excited in those bodies, and consequently by which a body becomes a burning coal, and smoke, flame; and, I suppose, flame is nothing but the particles of smoke turned by the access of light and heat to burning coals, little and innumerable.
<252>
Thirdly, as the air can pervade the bores of small glass pipes, but yet not so easily as if they were wider; and therefore stands at a greater degree of rarity than in the free aereal spaces, and at so much a greater degree of rarity as the pipe is smaller, as is known by the rising of water in such pipes to a much greater hight than the surface of the stagnating water, into which they are dipped; so I suppose æther, though it pervades the pores of crystal, glass, water, and other natural bodies, yet it stands at a greater degree of rarity in those pores, than in the free æthereal spaces, and at so much a greater degree of rarity, as the pores of the body are smaller. Whence it may be, that the spirit of wine, for instance, though a lighter body, yet having subtiler parts, and consequently smaller pores, than water, is the more strongly refracting liquor. This also may be the principal cause of the cohesion of the parts of solids and fluids, of the springiness of glass, and bodies, whose parts slide not one upon another in bending, and of the standing of the mercury in the Torricellian experiment, sometimes to the top of the glass, though a much greater hight than twenty-nine inches. For the denser æther, which surrounds these bodies, must croud and press their parts together, much after the manner that air surrounding two marbles presses them together, if there be little or no air between them. Yea, and that puzzling problem; By what means the muscles are contracted and dilated to cause animal motion, may receive greater light from hence than from any means men have hitherto been thinking on. For, if there be any power in man to condense and dilate at will the æther, that pervades the muscle, that condensation or dilation must vary the compression of the muscle, made by the ambient æther, and cause it to swell or shrink accordingly. For though common water will scarce shrink by compression, and swell by relaxation, yet (so far as my observation reaches) spirit of wine and oil will; and Mr. BOYLE'S experiment of a tadpole shrinking very much by hard compressing the water, in which it swam, is an argument, that animal juices do the same. And as for their various pression by the ambient æther, it is plain, that that must be more or less accordingly as there is more or less æther within, to sustain and counterpoise the pressure of that without. If both æthers were equally dense, the muscle would be at liberty, as if pressed by neither: if there were no æther within, the ambient would compress it with the whole force of its spring. If the æther within were twice as much dilated as that without, so as to have but half as much springiness, the ambient would have half the force of its springiness counterpoised thereby, and exercise but the other half upon the muscle; and so in all other cases the ambient compresses the muscle by the excess of the force of its springiness above that of the springiness of the included. To vary the compression of the muscle therefore, and so to swell and shrink it, there needs nothing but to change the consistence of the included æther; and a very little change may suffice, if the spring of æther be supposed very strong, as I take it to be many degrees stronger than that of air.
Now for the changing the consistence of the æther; some may be ready to grant, that the soul may have an immediate power over the whole æther in any part of the body, to swell or shrink it at will: but then how depends the <253> muscular motion on the nerves? Others therefore may be more apt to think it done by some certain æthereal spirit included within the dura mater, which the soul may have power to contract or dilate at will in any muscle, and so cause it to flow thither through the nerves. But still there is a difficulty, why this force of the soul upon it does not take off the power of its springiness, whereby it should sustain, more or less, the force of the outward æther. A third supposition may be, that the soul has a power to inspire any muscle with this spirit, by impelling it thither through the nerves. But this too has its difficulties, for it requires a forcible intending the spring of the æther in the muscles, by pressure exerted from the parts of the brain: and it is hard to conceive, how so great force can be exercised amidst so tender matter as the brain is. And besides, why does not this æthereal spirit, being subtil enough, and urged with so great force, go away through the dura mater and skins of the muscle; or at least so much of the other æther to go out to make way for this, which is crouded in? To take away these difficulties is a digression; but seeing the subject is a deserving one, I shall not stick to tell you how I think it may be done.
First then, I suppose, there is such a spirit; that is, that the animal spirits are neither like the liquor, vapour, or gas of spirit of wine; but of an æthereal nature, subtil enough to pervade the animal juices, as freely as the electric, or perhaps magnetic, effluvia do glass. And to know, how the coats of the brain, nerves, and muscles, may become a convenient vessel to hold so subtil a spirit, you may consider, how liquors and spirits are disposed to pervade or not pervade things on other accounts than their subtilty. Water and oil pervade wood and stone, which quicksilver does not; and quicksilver metals, which water and oil do not: water and acid spirits pervade salts, which oil and spirit of wine do not; and oil and spirit of wine pervade sulphur, which water and acid spirits do not. So some fluids, as oil and water, though their parts are in freedom enough to mix with one another, yet by some secret principle of unsociableness they keep asunder; and some, that are sociable, may become unsociable, by adding a third thing to one of them, as water to spirit of wine, by dissolving salt of tartar in it. The like unsociableness may be in æthereal natures, as perhaps between the æthers in the vortices of the sun and planets; and the reson, why air stands rarer in the boxes of small glass-pipes, and æther in the pores of bodies, than elsewhere, may be, not want of subtilty, but sociableness. And on this ground, if the æthereal vital spirit in a man be very sociable to the marrow and juices, and unsociable to the coats of the brain, nerves, and muscles, or any thing lodged in the pores of those we suppose no great violence done to it to squeeze it out; and that it may not be altogether so subtil as the main body of æther, though subtil enough to pervade readily the animal juices, and that, as any of it is spent, it is continually supplied by new spirit from the heart.
In the next place, for knowing how this spirit may be used for animal motion, you may consider, how some things unsociable are made sociable by the <254> mediation of a third. Water, which will not disolve copper, will do it, if the copper be melted with sulphur: aqua fortis, which will not pervade gold, will do it by addition of a little sal armoniac, or spirit of salt: lead will not mix in melting with copper, but if a little tin or antimony be added, they mix readily, and part again of their own accord, if the antimony be wasted by throwing saltpeter or otherwise: and so lead melted with silver quickly pervades and liquefies the silver in a much less heat than is requsite to melt the silver alone; but, if they be kept in the test till that little substance, that reconciled them, be wasted or altered, they part again of their own accord. And, in like manner, the æthereal animal spirit in a man may be a mediator between the common æther and the muscular juices, to make them mix more freely; and so, by sending a little of this spirit into any muscle, though so little as to cause no sensible tension of the muscle by its own force; yet, by rendering the juices more sociable to the common external æther, it may cause that æther to pervade the muscle of its own accord in a moment more freely and copiously than it would otherwise do, and to recede again as freely, so soon as this mediator of sociableness is retracted. Whence, according to what I said above, will proceed the swelling or shrinking of the muscle, and consequently the animal motion depending thereon.
Thus may therefore the soul, by determining this æthereal animal spirit or wind into this or that nerve, perhaps with as much ease as air is moved in open spaces, cause all the motions we see in animals: for the making which motions strong, it is not necessary, that we should suppose the æther within the muscle very much condensed or rarified by this means, but only that its spring is so very great, that a little alteration of its density shall cause a great alteration in the pressure, And what is said of muscular motion, may be applied to the motion of the heart, only with this difference, that the spirit is not sent thither, as into other muscles, but continually generated there by the fermentation of the juices, with which its flesh is replenished, and as it is generated, let out by starts into the brain through some convenient ductus to perform those motions in other muscles by impression, which it did in the heart by its generation. For I see not, why the ferment in the heart may not raise as subtil a spirit out of its juices, to cause these motions, as rubbing does out of a glass, to cause electric attraction, or burning out of fewel, to penetrate glass, as Mr. BOYLE has shewn, and calcine by corrosion metals melted therein.
Hitherto I have been contemplating the nature of æther and æthereal substances by their effects and uses; and now I come to join therewith the consideration of light.
In the fourth place therefore, I suppose light is neither æther, nor its vibrating motion, but something of a different kind propagated from lucid bodies. They, that will, may suppose it an aggregate of various peripatetic qualities. Others may suppose it multitudes of unimaginable small and swift corpuscles of various sizes, springing from shining bodies at great distances one after another; but yet without any sensible interval of time, and continually urged forward by a <255> principle of motion, which in the beginning accelerates them, till the resistence of the æthereal medium equal the force of that principle, much after the manner that bodies let fall in water are accelerated till the resistance of the water equals the force of gravity. God, who gave animals self-motion beyond our understanding, is, without doubt, able to implant other principles of motion in bodies, which we may understand as little. Some would readily grant this may be a spiritual one; yet a mechanical one might be shewn, did not I think it better to pass it by. But they, that like not this, may suppose light any other corporeal emanation, or any impulse or motion of any other medium or æthereal spirit diffused through the main body of æther, or what else they can imagine proper for this purpose. To avoid dispute, and make this hypothesis general, let every man here take his fancy: only, whatever light be, I suppose, it consists of rays differing from one another in contingent circumstances, as bigness, form, or vigour; like as the sands on the shore, the waves of the sea, the faces of men, and all other natural things of the same kind differ; it being almost impossible for any sort of things to be found without some contingent variety. And further, I would suppose it diverse, from the vibrations of the æther, because (besides, that were it these vibrations, it ought always to verge copiously in crooked lines into the dark or quiescent medium, destroying all shadows; and to comply readily with any crooked pores or passages, as sounds do,) I see not how any superficies (as the side of a glassprism, on which the rays within are incident at an angle of above forty degrees) can be totally opake. For the vibrations beating against the refracting confine of the rarer and denser æther must needs make that pliant superficies undulate, and those undulations will stir up and propagate vibrations on the other side. And further, how light, incident on very thin skins or plates of any transparent body, should, for many successive thicknesses of the plate in arithmetical progression, be alternately reflected and transmitted, as I find it is, puzzles me as much. For, though the arithmetical progression of those thicknesses, which reflect and transmit the rays alternately, argues, that it depends upon the number of vibrations between the two superficies of the plate, whether the ray shall be reflected or transmitted: yet I cannot see, how the number should vary the case, be it greater or less, whole or broken, unless light be supposed something else than these vibrations. Something indeed I could fancy towards helping the two last difficulties, but nothing which I see not insufficient.
Fifthly, it is to be supposed, that light and æther mutually act upon one another, æther in refracting light, and light in warming æther; and that the densest æther acts most strongly. When a ray therefore moves through æther of uneven density, I suppose it most pressed, urged, or acted upon by the medium on that side towards the denser æther, and receives a continual impulse or ply from that side to recede towards the rarer, and so is accelerated, if it move that way, or retarded, if the contrary. On this ground, if a ray move obliquely through such an unevenly dense medium (that is, obliquely to those imaginary superficies, which run through the equally dense parts of the medium, and may be called the refracting superficies) it must be incurved, as it <256> is found to be, by observation in water1[4] , whose lower parts were made gradually more salt, and so more dense than the upper. And this may be the ground of all refraction and reflexion: for as the rarer air within a small glass-pipe, and the denser without, are not distinguished by a meer mathematical superficies, but have air between them, at the orifice of the pipe, running through all intermediate degrees of density: so I suppose the refracting superficies of æther, between unequally dense mediums, to be not a mathematical one; but of some breadth, the æther therein, at the orifices of the pores of the solid body, being of all intermediate degrees of density between the rarer and denser æthereal mediums; and the refraction I conceive to proceed from the continual incurvation of the ray all the while it is passing the physical superficies. Now, if the motion of the ray be supposed in this passage to be increased or diminished in a certain proportion, according to the difference of the densities of the æthereal mediums, and the addition or detraction of the motion be reckoned in the perpendicular from the refracting superficies, as it ought to be, the sines of incidence and refraction will be proportional according to what DES CARTES has demonstrated.
The ray therefore, in passing out of the rarer medium into the denser, inclines continually more and more towards parallelism with the refracting superficies; and if the differing densities of the mediums be not so great, nor the incidence of the ray so oblique, as to make it parallel to that superficies before it gets through, then it goes through and is refracted; but if, through the aforesaid causes, the ray become parallel to that superficies before it can get through, then it must turn back and be reflected. Thus, for instance, may be observed in a triangular glass-prism O E F, that the rays A n, that send out of the glass into the air, do, by inclining them more and more to the refracting superficies, emerge more and more obliquely till they be infinitely oblique; that is, in a manner parallel to the superficies, which happens when the angle of incidence is about forty degrees; and then, if they be a little more inclined are all reflected, as at A V λ, becoming, I suppose, parallel to the superficies before they can get through it. Let A B D C represent the rarer medium; E F H G the denser, C D F E the space between them, or refracting physical superficies, in which the æther is of all intermediate degrees of density, from the rarest æther at C D, to the densest, at E F; A m n L a ray, A m its incident part, m n its incurvation by the refracting superficies, and n L its emergent part. Now, if the ray A m be so much incurved as to become at its emergence n, as nearly as may be, parallel to C D, it is plain, that if that ray had been incident a little more obliquely, <257> it must have become parallel to C D, before it had arrived at E F,the further side of the refracting superficies; and so could have got no nearer to E F, but must have turned back by further incurvation, and been reflected, as it is represented at A μ V λ. And the like would have happened, if the density of the æther had further increased from E F to P Q; so that P Q H G might be a denser medium than E F H G was supposed; for then the ray, in passing from m to n, being so much incurved, as at n to become parallel to C D or P Q, it is impossible it should ever get nearer to P Q, but must at n begin by further incurvation to turn back, and so be reflected. And because, if a refracted ray, as n L, be made incident, the incident, A m, shall become the refracted; and therefore, if the ray A μ V, after it is arrived at V, where I suppose it parallel to the refracting superficies, should be refracted perpendicularly back, it would return back in the line of incidence V μ A. Therefore going forward, it must go forward in such another line, V π λ, both cases being alike, and so be reflected at an angle, equal to that of incidence.
This may be the cause and manner of reflection, when light tends from the rarer towards the denser æther: but to know, how it should be reflected, when it stands from the denser towards the rarer, you are further to consider, how fluids near their superficies are less pliant and yielding than in their more inward parts; and, if formed into thin plates, or shells, they become much more stiff and tenacious than otherwise. Thus, things, which readily fall in water, if let fall upon a bubble of water, they do not easily break through it, but are apt to slide down by the sides of it, if they be not too big and heavy. So, if two well polished convex glasses, ground on very large spheres, be laid one upon another, the air between them easily recedes, till they almost touch; but then begins to resist so much, that the weight of the upper glass is too little to bring them together so as to make the black, mentioned in the other papers I send you, appear in the midst of the rings of colours: and, if the glasses be plain, though no broader than a two-pence, a man with his whole strength is not able to press all the air out from between them, so as to make them fully touch. You may observe also, that insects will walk upon water without wetting their feet, and the water bearing them up; also motes falling upon water will often lie long upon it without being wetted: and so, I suppose, æther in the confine of two mediums is less pliant and yielding than in other places, and so much the less pliant by how much the mediums differ in density: so that in passing out of denser æther into rarer, when there remains but a very little of the denser æther to be past through, a ray finds more than ordinary difficulty to get through; and so great difficulty, where the mediums are of very differing density, as to be reflected by incurvation, after the manner described above; the parts of æther on that side, where they are less pliant and yielding, acting upon the ray much after the manner that they would do were they denser there than on the other side: for the resistance of the medium ought to have the same effect on the ray, from what cause soever it arises. And this, I suppose, may be the cause of the reflection of quicksilver, and other metalline bodies. It must also concur to increase the reflective virtue of the superficies, when rays tend out of the rarer medium into the <258> denser: and, in that case therefore, the reflection having a double cause, ought to be stronger than in the æther, as it is apparently. But in refraction, this rigid tenacity or unpliableness of the superficies need not be considered, because so much as the ray is thereby bent in passing to the most tenacious and rigid part of the superficies, so much it is thereby unbent again in passing on from thence through the next parts gradually less tenacious.
Thus may rays be refracted by some superficies, and reflected by others, be the medium they tend into, denser or rarer. But it remains further to be explained, how rays alike incident on the same superficies (suppose of crystal, glass, or water) may be at the same time some refracted, others reflected. And for explaining this, I suppose, that the rays, when they impinge on the rigid resisting æthereal superficies, as they are acted upon by it, so they react upon it and cause vibrations in it, as stones thrown into water do in its surface; and that these vibrations are propagated every way into both the rarer and the denser mediums; as the vibrations of air, which cause sound, are from a stroke, but yet continue strongest where they began, and alternately contract and dilate the æther in that physical superficies. For it is plain by the heat, which light produces in bodies, that it is able to put their parts in motion, and much more to heat and put in motion the more tender æther; and it is more probable, that it communicates motion to the gross parts of bodies by the mediation of æther than immediately; as for instance, in the inward parts of quicksilver, tin, silver, and other very opake bodies, by generating vibrations, that run through them, than by striking the outward parts only, without entering the body. The shock of every single ray may generate many thousand vibrations, and by sending them all over the body, move all the parts, and that perhaps with more motion than it could move one single part by an immediate stroke; for the vibrations, by shaking each particle backward and forward, may every time increase its motion, as a ringer does a bell by often pulling it, and so at length move the particles to a very great degree of agitation, which neither the simple shock of a ray, nor any other motion in the æther, besides a vibrating one could do. Thus in air shut up in a vessel, the motion of its parts caused by heat, how violent soever, is unable to move the bodies hung in it, with either a trembling or progressive motion: but if air be put into a vibrating motion by beating a drum or two, it shakes glass-windows, the whole body of a man, and other massy things, especially those of a congruous tone: yea I have observed it manifestly shake under my feet a cellared free-stone floor of a large hall, so as, I believe, the immediate stroke of five hundred drumsticks could not have done, unless perhaps quicky succeeding one another at equal intervals of time. Æthereal vibrations are therefore the best means by which such a subtile agent as light can shake the gross particles of solid bodies to heat them: and so supposing that light, impinging on a refracting or reflecting æthereal superficies, puts it into a vibrating motion, that physical superficies being by the perpetual appulse of rays always kept in a vibrating motion, and the æther therein continually expanded and compressed by turns; if a ray of light impinge upon it, while it is much compressed, I suppose it is then too dense and stiff to let the ray <259> pass through, and so reflects it; but the rays, that impinge on it at other times, when it is either expanded by the interval of two vibrations, or not too much compressed and condensed, go through and are refracted.
These may be the causes of refractions and reflections in all cases; but, for understanding how they come to be so regular, it is further to be considered, that in a heap of sand, although the surface be rugged, yet if water be poured on it to fill its pores, the water, so soon as its pores are filled, will evenly overspread the surface, and so much the more evenly, as the sand is finer: so, although the surface of all bodies, even the most polished, be rugged, as I conceive, yet where that ruggedness is not too gross and coarse, the refracting æthereal superficies may evenly overspread it. In polishing glass or metal, it is not to be imagined, that sand, putty, or other fretting powders, should wear the surface so regularly, as to make the front of every particle exactly plain, and all those plains look the same way, as they ought to do in well polished bodies, were reflection performed by their parts: but that those fretting powders should wear the bodies first to a coarse ruggedness, such is sensible, and then to a finer and finer ruggedness, till it be so fine that the æthereal superficies evenly overspreads it, and so makes the body put on the appearance of a polish, is a very natural and intelligible supposition. So in fluids, it is not well to be conceived, that the surfaces of their parts should be all plain, and the plains of the superficial parts always kept looking all the same way, notwithstanding that they are in perpetual motion. And yet without these two suppositions, the superficies of fluids could not be so regularly reflexive as they are, were the reflexion done by the parts themselves, and not by an æthereal superficies evenly overspreading the fluid.
Further, concerning the regular motion of light, it might be suspected, whether the various vibrations of the fluid, through which it passes, may not much disturb it: but that suspicion, I suppose, will vanish, by considering, that if at any time the foremost part of an oblique wave begin to turn it awry, the hindermost part, by a contrary action, must soon set it straight again.
Lastly, because without doubt there are, in every transparent body, pores of various sizes, and I said, that æther stands at the greatest rarity in the smallest pores; hence the æther in every pore should be of a differing rarity, and so light be refracted in its passage out of every pore into the next, which would cause a great confusion, and spoil the body's transparency. But considering that the æther, in all dense bodies, is agitated by continual vibrations, and these vibrations cannot be performed without forcing the parts of æther forward and backward, from one pore to another, by a kind of tremor, so that the æther, which one moment is in a greater pore, is the next moment forced into a less; and on the contrary, this must evenly spread the æther into all the pores not exceeding some certain bigness, suppose the breadth of a vibration, and so make it of an even density throughout the transparent body, agreeable to the middle sort of pores. But where the pores exceed a certain bigness, I suppose the æther suits its density to the bigness of the pore, or to the medium within it; and so being of a diverse density from the æther that surrounds it, refracts <260> or reflects light in its superficies, and so make the body, where many such interstices are, appear opake.
Some of the members taking particular notice, among other things, of an experiment mentioned in this hypothesis, desired, that it might be tried; viz. that having laid upon a table a round piece of glass, about two inches broad, in a brass ring; so that the glass might be one third part of an inch from the table; and then rubbing the glass briskly, till some little fragments of paper laid on the table under the glass began to be attracted, and move nimbly to and fro; after he had done rubbing the glass, the papers would continue a pretty while in various motions, sometimes leaping up to the glass, and resting there a while, then leaping down, and resting there, and then leaping up and down again, and this sometimes in lines seeming perpendicular to the table, sometimes in oblique ones; sometimes also leaping up in one arch, and leaping down in another divers times together, without sensibly resting between; sometimes skipping in a bow from one part of the glass to another, without touching the table, and sometimes hanging by a corner, and turning often about very nimbly, as if they had been carried about in the middle of a whirlwind; and being otherwise variously moved, every paper with a different motion. And upon sliding his finger upon the upper side of the glass, though neither the glass not the inclosed air below were moved thereby, yet would the papers, as they hung under the glass, receive some new motion, inclining this or that way, according as he moved his finger.
This experiment Mr. NEWTON proposed to be varied with a larger glass placed farther from the table, and to make use of bits of leaf gold instead of papers; thinking, that this would succeed much better, so as perhaps to make the leaf gold rise and fall in spiral lines, or whirl for a time in the air, without touching either the table or glass.
It was ordered, that this experiment should be tried at the next meeting; and Mr. HOOKE promised to prepare it for that meeting.
Mr. OLDENBURG was desired to enquire by letter of Mr. NEWTON, whether he would consent, that a copy might be taken of his papers, for the better consideration of their contents.
Mr. OLDENBURG presented from Mr. MARTYN, the printer to the Society, Mr. WILLUGHBY'S Ornithologia, printed at London, 1676, in fol.
December 16. Mr. NEWTON'S experiment of glass rubbed to cause various motions in bits of paper underneath, was tried, but did not succeed in those circumstances, with which it was tried. This trial was made upon the reading of a letter of his own to Mr. OLDENBURG, dated at Cambridge, 14th December, 1675m[5] , in which he gives some more particular directions about that experiment.
The letter was as follows:
<261>
The notice you gave me of the Royal Society's intending to see the experiment of glass rubbed, to cause various motions in bits of paper underneath, put me upon recollecting myself a little further about it; and then remembring, that, if one edge of the brass hoop was laid downward, the glass was as near again on the table as it was when the other edge was laid downward, and that the papers played best when the glass was nearest to the table; I began to suspect, that I had set down a greater distance of the glass from the table than I should have done; for in setting down that experiment, I trusted to the idea I had of the bigness of the hoop, in which I might easily be mistaken, having not seen it of a long time. And this suspicion was increased by trying the experiment with an object glass of a telescope, placed about the third part of an inch from the table; for I could not see the papers play any thing near so well as I had seen them formerly. Whereupon I looked for the old hoop with its glass, and at length found the hoop, the glass being gone; but by the hoop I perceived, that, when one edge was turned down, the glass was almost the third part of an inch from the table, and when the other edge was down, which made the papers play so well, the glass was scarce the eighth part of an inch from the table. This I thought fit to signify to you, that, if the experiment succeed not well at the distance I set down, it may be tried at a less distance, and that you may alter my paper, and write in it the eighth part of an inch instead of  or  of an inch. The bits of paper ought to be very little, and of thin paper; perhaps little bits of the wings of a fly, or other light substances, may do better than paper. Some of the motions, as that of hanging by a corner and twirling about, and that of leaping from one part of the glass to another, without touching the table, happen but seldom; but it made me take the more notice of them.
Pray present my humble service to Mr. BOYLE, when you see him, and thanks for the favour of the converse I had with him at Spring. My conceit of trepaning the common æther, as he was pleased to express it, makes me begin to have the better thoughts on that he was pleased to entertain with a smile. I am apt to think, that when he has a set of experiments to try in his air-pump, he will make that one, to see how the compression or relaxation of a muscle will shrink or swell, soften or harden, lengthen or shorten it.
As for registring the two discourses, you may do it; only I desire you would suspend till my next letter, in which I intend to set down something to be altered, and something to be added in the hypothesis.
It was ordered, that Mr. OLDENBURG should again write to Mr. NEWTON, and acquaint him with the want of success of his experiment, and desire him to send his own apparatus, with which he had made it: as also to enquire, whether he had secured the papers being moved from the air, that might somewhere steal in.
Hereupon the sequel of his hypothesis, the first part of which was read at the preceding meetings, was read to the end.
<262> 
Thus much of refraction, reflection, transparency, and opacity; and now to explain colours; I suppose, that as bodies of various sizes, densities, or sensations, do by percussion or other action excite sounds of various tones, and consequently vibrations in the air of various bigness; so when the rays of light, by impinging on the stiff refracting superficies, excite vibrations in the æther, those rays, whatever they be, as they happen to differ in magnitude, strength or vigour, excite vibrations of various bigness; the biggest, strongest, or most potent rays, the largest vibrations; and others shorter, according to their bigness, strength, or power: and therefore the ends of the capillamenta of the optic nerve, which pave or face the retina, being such refracting superficies, when the rays impinge upon them, they must there excite these vibrations, which vibrations (like those of sound in a trunk or trumpet) will run along the aqueous pores or crystalline pith of the capillamenta through the optic nerves into the sensorium (which light itself cannot do) and there, I suppose, affect the sense with various colours, according to their bigness and mixture; the biggest with the strongest colours, reds and yellows; the least with the weakest, blues and violets; the middle with green, and a confusion of all with white, much after the manner, that in the sense of hearing, nature makes use of aereal vibrations of several bignesses to generate sounds of divers tones; for the analogy of nature is to be observed. And further, as the harmony and discord of sounds proceed from the proportions of the aereal vibrations, so may the harmony of some colours, as of golden and blue, and the discord of others, as of red and blue, proceed from the proportions of the æthereal. And possibly colour may be distinguished into its principal degrees, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, and deep violet, on the same ground, that sound within an eighth is graduated into tones. For, some years past, the prismatic colours being in a well darkened room cast perpendicularly upon a paper about two and twenty foot distant from the prism, I desired a friend to draw with a pencil lines cross the image, or pillar of colours, where every one of the seven aforenamed colours was most full and brisk, and also where he judged the truest confines of them to be, whilst I held the paper so, that the said image might fall within a certain compass marked on it. And this I did, partly because my own eyes are not very critical in distinguishing colours, partly because another, to whom I had not communicated my thoughts about this matter, could have nothing but his eyes to determine his fancy in making those marks. This observation we repeated divers times, both in the same and divers days, to see how the marks on several papers would agree; and comparing the observations, though the just confines of the colours are hard to be assigned, because they pass into one another by insensible gradation; yet the differences of the observations were but little, especially towards the red end, and taking means between those differences, that were, the length of the image (reckoned not by the distance of the verges of the semicircular ends, but by the distance of the centres of those semicircles, or length of the strait sides as it ought to be) was divided in about the same proportion that a string is, between the end and the middle, to sound the tones in the eighth. You will understand me best by viewing the annexed figure, in which A B and C D represent the strait sides, about ten inches long, A B C and B T D the semicircular ends, X and <263> Y the centres of those semicicles, X Z the length of a musical string double to X Y, and divided between X and Y, so as to sound the tones expressed at the side (that is X H the half, X G and G I the third part, Y K the fifth part, Y M the eighth part, and G E the ninth part of X Y) and the intervals between these divisions express the spaces which the colours written there took up, every colour being the most briskly specific in the middle of those spaces.
Now for the cause of these and such like colours made by refraction, the biggest or strongest rays must penetrate the refracting superficies more freely and easily than the weaker, and so be less turned awry by it, that is, less refracted; which is as much as to say, the rays, which make red, are least refrangible, those, which make blue and violet, most refrangible, and others otherwise refrangible according to their colour: whence, if the rays, which come promiscuously from the sun, be refracted by a prism, as in the aforesaid experiment, these of several sorts being variously refracted, must go to several places on an opposite paper or wall, and so parted, exhibit every one their own colours, which they could not do while blended together. And, because refraction only severs them, and changes not the bigness or strength of the ray, thence it is, that after they are once well severed, refraction cannot make any further changes in their colour.
On this ground may all the phænomena of refractions be understood: but to explain the colours made by reflections, I must further suppose, that, though light be unimaginably swift, yet the æthereal vibrations, excited by a ray, move faster than the ray itself, and so overtake and outrun it one after another. And this, I suppose, they will think an allowable supposition, who have been inclined to suspect, that these vibrations themselves might be light. But to make it the more allowable, it is possible light itself may not be so swift, as some are apt to think; for, notwithstanding any argument, that I know yet to the contrary, it may be an hour or two, if not more, in moving from the sun to us. This celerity of the vibrations therefore supposed, if light be incident on a thin skin or plate of any transparent body, the waves, excited by its passage through the first superficies, overtaking it one after another, till it arrive at the second superficies, will cause it to be there reflected or refracted accordingly as the condensed or expanded part of the wave overtakes it there. If the plate be of such a thickness, that the condensed part of the first wave overtake the ray at the second superficies, it must be reflected there; if double that thickness, that the following rarified part of the wave, that is, the space between that and the next <264> wave, overtake it, there it must be transmitted; if triple the thickness, that the condensed part of the second wave overtake it, there it must be reflected, and so where the plate is five, seven, or nine times that thickness, it must be reflected by reason of the third, fourth, or fifth wave, overtaking it at the second superficies; but when it is four, six, or eight times that thickness, so that the ray may be overtaken there by the dilated interval of those waves, it shall be transmitted, and so on; the second superficies being made able or unable to reflect accordingly as it is condensed or expanded by the waves. For instance, let A H Q represent the superficies of a spherically convex glass laid upon a plain glass A I R, and A I R Q H the thin plane-concave plate of air between them, and B C, D E, F G, H I, &c. thicknesses of that plate, or distances of the glasses in the arithmetical progression of the numbers 1. 2. 3. 4. &c. whereof B C is the distance, at which the ray is overtaken by the most condensed part of the first wave: I say, the rays incident at B, F, K, and O, ought to be reflected at C, G, L, and P, and those incident at D, H, M, and Q, ought to be transmitted at E, I, N, and R; and this, because the ray B C arrives at the superficies A C, when it is condensed, by the first wave that overtakes it; D E, when rarified by the interval of the first and second; F G when condensed by the second wave; H I, when rarified by the interval of the second and third; and so on  for an indeterminate number of successions; and at A, the center or contact of the glasses, the light must be transmitted, because there the æthereal mediums in both glasses are continued as if but one uniform medium. Whence, if the glasses in this posture be looked upon, there ought to appear at A, the contact of the glasses, a black spot, and about that many concentric circles of light and darkness, the squares of whose semidiameters are to sense and arithmetical progression. Yet all the rays, without exception, ought not to be thus reflected or transmitted: for sometimes a ray may be overtaken at the second superficies, by the vibrations raised by another collateral or immediately succeeding ray; which vibration, being as strong or stronger than its own, may cause it to be reflected or transmitted when its own vibration alone would do the contrary. And hence some little light will be reflected from the black rings, which makes <265> them rather black than totally dark; and some transmitted at the lucid rings, which makes the black rings, appearing on the other side of the glasses, not so black as they would otherwise be. And so at the central black spot, where the glasses do not absolutely touch, a little light will be reflected, which makes the spot darkest in the middle, and only black at the verges. For thus I have observed it to be, by tying very hard together two glass prisms, which were accidentally (one of them at least) a very little convex, and viewing by divers lights this black spot at their contact. If a white paper was placed at a litle distance behind a candle, and the candle and paper viewed alternately by reflection from the spot, the verges of the spot, which looked by the light of the paper as black as the middle part, appeared by the stronger light of the candle lucid enough, so as to make the spot seem less than before; but in the middle part continued as absolutely black in one case as in the other, some specks and streaks in it only excepted, where I suppose the glasses, through some unevenness in the polish, did not fully touch. The same I have observed by viewing the spot by the like reflection of the sun and clouds alternately.
But to return to the lucid and black rings, those rings ought always to appear after the manner described, were light uniform. And after that manner, when two contiguous glasses A Q and A R have been illustrated, in a dark room, by light of any uniform colour made by a prism, I have seen the lucid circles appear to about twenty in number, with many dark ones between them, the colour of the lucid ones being that of the light, with which the glasses were illustrated. And if the glasses were held between the eye and prismatic colours, cast on a sheet of white-paper, or if any prismatic colour was directly trajected through the glasses to a sheet of paper placed a little way behind, there would appear such other rings of colour and darkness (in the first case between the glasses, in the second, on the paper) oppositely corresponding to those, which appeared by reflection: I mean, that, whereas by reflected light there appeared a black spot in the middle, and then a coloured circle; on the contrary, by transmitted light there appeared a coloured spot in the middle, and then a black circle, and so on; the diameters of the coloured circles, made by transmission, equalling the diameters of the black ones made by reflection.
Thus, I say, the rings do and ought to appear when made by uniform light; but in compound light it is otherwise. For the rays, which exhibit red and yellow, exciting, as I said, larger pulses in the æther than those, which make blue and violet, and consequently making bigger circles in a certain proportion, as I have manifestly found they do, by illuminating the glasses successively by the aforesaid colours of prism in a well darkened room, without changing the position of my eye or of the glasses; hence the circles, made by illustrating the glasses with white light, ought not to appear black and white by turns, as the circles made by illustrating the glasses; for instance, with red light, appear red and black; but the colours, which compound the white light, must display themselves by being reflected, the blue and violet nearer to the center than the red and yellow, whereby every lucid circle must become violet in the inward verge, red in the outward, and of intermediate colours in the intermediate <266> parts, and be made broader than before, spreading the colours both ways into those spaces, which I call the black rings, and which would here appear black, were the red, yellow, blue, and violet, which make the verge of the rings, taken out of the incident white light, which illustrates the glasses, and the green only left to make the lucid rings. Suppose C B, G D, L F, P M, R N, S X, represent quadrants of the circles made in a dark room by the very deepest prismatic red alone; and Y β, γ δ, λ φ, π μ, ρ ν, σ ξ, the quadrants of like circles made also in a dark room, by the very deepest prismatic violet alone: and then, if the glasses be illuminated by open day light, in which all sorts of rays are blended, it is manifest, that the first lucid ring will be Y β B C; the second γ δ D G, the third, λ φ F L, the fourth π μ M P, the fifth ρ ν N R, the sixth σ ξ X S, &c. in all which the deepest violet must be reflected at the inward edges represented by the pricked lines, where it would be reflected were it alone, and the deepest red at the outward edges represented by the black lines, where it would be reflected, were it alone; and all intermediate colours at those places, in order, between these edges, at which they would be reflected were they alone; each of them in a dark room, parted from all other colours by the refraction of a prism. And because the squares of the semidiameters of the outward verges AC, A G, A L, &c. as also of A Y, A γ, A λ, &c. the semidiameters of the inward are in arithmetical progression of the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. and the squares of the inward are to the squares of the outward (A Y9 to A C9, A γ9 to A G9, A λ9 to A L9, &c.) as 9 to 14, (as I have found by measuring them carefully and often, and comparing the observations:) therefore the outward red verge of the second ring, and inward violet one of the third, shall border upon one another (as you may know by computation, and see them represented in the figure) and the like edges of the third and fourth rings shall interfere, and those of the fourth and fifth interfere more, and so on. Yea, the colours of every ring must spread themselves something more both ways than is here represented, because the quadrantal arcs here described represent not the verges, but the middle of the rings made in a dark room by the extreme violet and red; the violet falling on both sides the pricked arches, and red on both sides the black line arches. And hence it is, that these rings or circuits of colours succeed one another continually, without any <267> intevening black, and that the colours are pure only in the three or four first rings, and then intervening and mixing more and more, dilute one another so much, that after eight of nine rings they are no more to be distinguished, but seem to constitute an even whiteness; whereas, when they were made in a dark room by one of the prismatic colours alone, I have, as I said, seen above twenty of them, and without doubt could have seen them to a greater number, had I taken the pains to make the primatic colours more uncompounded. For by unfolding these rings from one another, by certain refractions expressed in the others[6] papers I send you, I have, even in day-light, discovered them to above an hundred; and perhaps they would have appeared innumerable, had the light or colour illustrating the glasses been absolutely uncompounded, and the pupil of my eye but a mathematical point; so that the rays, which came from the same point of the glass might have gone into my eye at the same obliquity to the glass.
What has been hitherto said of the rings, is to be understood of their appearance to an unmoved eye: but if you vary the position of the eye, the more obliquely you look on the glass, the larger the rings appear. And of this the reason may be, partly that an oblique ray is longer in passing through the first superficies, and so there is more time between the waving forward and backward of that superficies, and consequently a larger wave generated, and partly, that the wave in creeping along between the two superficies may be impeded and retarded by the rigidness of those superficies, bounding it at either end, and so not overtake the ray so soon as a wave, that moves perpendicularly cross.
The bigness of the circles made by every colour, and at all obliquities of the eye to the glass, and the thickness of the air, or intervals of the glasses, where each circle is made, you will find expressed in the other papers I send you; where also I have more at large described, how much these rings interfere, or spread into one another; what colours appear in every ring, where they are most lively, where and how much diluted by mixing with the colours of other rings; and how the contrary colours appear on the back side of the glasses by the transmitted light, the glasses transmitting light of one colour at the same place, where they reflect that of another. Nor need I add any thing further of the colours of other thinly plated mediums, as of water between the aforesaid glasses, or formed into bubbles, and so encompassed with air, or of glass blown into very thin bubbles at a lamp furnace, &c. the case being the same in all these, excepting that, where the thickness of the plate is not regular, the rings will not be so; that in plates of denser transparent bodies, the rings are made at a less thickness of the plate (the vibrations, I suppose, being shorter in rarer æther than in denser) and that in a denser plate, surrounded with a rarer body, the colours are more vivid than in the rarer surrounded with the denser; as, for instance, more vivid in a plate of glass surrounded with air, than in a plate of air surrounded with glass; of which the reason is, that the reflection of the second superficies, which causes the colours, is, as was said above, stronger in the for <268> mer case than in the latter: for which reason also the colours are most vivid, when the difference of the density of the medium is greatest.
Of the colours of natural bodies also I have said enough in those papers, shewing how the various sizes of the transparent particles, of which they consist, is sufficient to produce them all, those particles reflecting or transmitting this or that sort of rays, according to their thickness, like the aforesaid plates, as if they were fragments thereof. For, I suppose, if a plate of an even thickness, and consequently of an uniform colour, were broken into fragments of the same thickness with the plate, a heap of those fragments would be a powder much of the same colour with the plates. And so, if the parts be of the thickness of the water in the black spot at the top of a bubble described in the seventeenth of the observations I send you, I suppose the body must be black. In the production of which blackness, I suppose, that the particles of that size being disposed to reflect almost no light outward, but to refract it continually in its passage from every part to the next; by this multitude of refractions, the rays are kept so long straggling to and fro within the body, till at last almost all impinge on the solid parts of the body, and so are stopped and stifled; those parts having no sufficient elasticity, or other disposition to return nimbly enough the smart shock of the ray back upon it.
I should here conclude, but that there is another strange phænomenon of colours, which may deserve to be taken notice of. Mr. HOOKE, you may remember, was speaking of an odd straying of light, caused in its passage near the edge of a razor, knife, or other opake body in a dark room; the rays, which pass very near the edge, being thereby made to stray at all angles into the shadow of the knife.
To this Sir WILLIAM PETTY, then president, returned a very pertinent query, Whether that straying was in curve lines? and that made me, having heard Mr. HOOKE some days before compare it to the straying of sound into the quiescent medium, say, that I took it to be only a new kind of refraction, caused perhaps by the external æther's beginning to grow rarer a little before it came at the opake body, than it was in free spaces; the denser æther without the body, and the rarer within it, being terminated not in a mathematical superficies, but passing into one another through all intermediate degrees of density: whence the rays, that pass so near the body, as to come within that compass, where the outward æther begins to grow rarer, must be refracted by the uneven denseness thereof, and blended inwards toward the rarer medium of the body. To this Mr. HOOKE was then pleased to answer, that though it should be but a new kind of refraction, yet it was a new one. What to make of this unexpected reply, I knew not; having no other thoughts, but that a new kind of refraction might be as noble an invention as any thing else about light; but it made me afterwards, I know not upon what occasion, happen to say, among some that were present to what passed before, that I thought I had seen the experiment before in some Italian author. And the author is HONORATUS FABER, in his dialogue De Lumine, who had it from GRIMALDO; <269> whom I mention, because I am to describe something further out of him, which you will apprehend by this figure: supppose the sun shine through the little hole H K into a dark room upon the paper P Q, and with a wedge M N O intercept all but a little of that beam, and you will see upon the paper six rows of colours, R, S, T, V, X, Y, and beyond them a very faint light spreading either way, such as rays broken, like H N Z, must make. The author describes it more largely in divers schemes. I have time only to hint the sum of what he says.
Now for the breaking of the ray H N Z, suppose, in the next figure M N O be the solid wedge, A B C the inward bound of the uniform rarer æther within, beween which bounds the æther runs through all the intermediate degrees; and it is manifest, that, if a ray come between B and N, it must in its passage there bend from the denser medium towards C, and that so much the more, by how much it comes nearer N. Further, for the three rows of colours V X Y, those may perhaps proceed from the number of vibrations (whether one, two, or three) which overtake the ray in its passage from G, till it be about the mid-way between G and H; that is, at its nearest distance to N, so as to touch the circle described about N, with that distance; by the last of which vibrations, expanding or contracting the medium there, the ray is licensed to recede again from N, and go on to make the colours; or further bent about N, till the interval of the next wave overtake it, and give it liberty to go from N, very nearly in the line it is then moving, suppose toward Z, to cause the faint light spoken of above, you will understand me a little better, by comparing this with what was said of the colours of thin transparent plates, comparing the greatest distance that the ray goes from G B H towards N, to the thickness of one of those plates. Something too there is in DES CARTES'S explication of the rainbow's colours, which would give further light in this. But I have no time left to insist further upon particulars; nor do I propound this without diffidence, having not made sufficient observation about it.
After reading this discourse, Mr. HOOKE said, that the main of it was contained in his Micrographia, which Mr. NEWTON had only carried farther in some particulars.
The Society adjourned till December 30.
<270>
December 30. There was read a letter to Mr. OLDENBURG from Mr. NEWTON, dated at Cambridge 21st December, 1675t[7] , in answer to what had been written to him by Mr. OLDENBURG concerning the want of success of his experiment made with a glass rubbed &c. This letter was as follows:
Upon your letter I took another glass four inches broad, and one fourth of an inch thick, of such glass as telescopes are made of, and placed it a one sixth part of an inch from the table. It was set in such a piece of wood, as the object-glasses of telescopes use to be set in: and the experiment succeeded well. After the rubbing was still, and all was still, the motion of the papers would continue sometimes while I counted a hundred, every paper leaping up about twenty times more or less, and down as often. I tried also with two other glasses that belong to a telescope, and it succeeded with both; and I make no question but any glass will do that, if it be excited to electric virtue, as I think any may. If you have a mind to any of these glasses, you may have them; but I suppose, if you cannot make it do in other glass, you will fail in any I can send you. I am apt to suspect the failure was in the manner of rubbing; for I have observed, that the rubbing variously, or with various things, alters the case. At one time I rubbed the aforesaid great glass with a napkin, twice as much as I used to do with my gown, and nothing would stir; and yet presently rubbing it with something else, the motions soon began. After the glass has been much rubbed too, the motions are not so lasting; and the next day I found the motions fainter and difficulter to excite than the first. If the Society have a mind to attempt it any more, I can give no better advice than this: to take a new glass not yet rubbed (perhaps one of the old ones may do well enough after it has lain still a while) and let this be rubbed, not with linen, nor soft nappy woolen, but with stuff, whose threads may rake the surface of the glass, suppose tamerine, or the like, doubled up in the hand, and this with a brisk motion as may be, till an hundred or an hundred and fifty may be counted, the glass lying all the while over the papers. Then, if nothing stir, rub the glass with the finger ends half a score of times to and fro, or knock your fingerends as often upon the glass; for this rubbing or knocking with your fingers, after the former rubbing, conduces most to excite the papers. If nothing stir yet, rub again with the cloth till sixty or eighty may be counted, and then rub or knock again with your fingers, and repeat this till the electric virtue of the glass be so far excited as to take up the papers, and then a very little rubbing or knocking now and then will revive the motions. In doing all this, let the rubbing be always done as nimbly as may be; and if the motion be circular, like that of glass-grinding, it may do better. But if you cannot make it yet succeed, it must be let alone till I have some opportunity of trying it before you. As for the suspicion of the papers being moved by the air, I am secure from that; yet in the other, of drawing leaf-gold to above a foot distance, which I never went about to try myself till the last week, I suspect the air might raise the gold, and then a small attraction might determine it towards the glass; for I could not make it succeed.
<271>
It was ordered, that Mr. NEWTON'S directions in this letter should be observed in the experiment to be made at the next meeting of the Society.
Mr. OLDENBURG read a letter to himself from Mr. JOHN GASCOIGNE, dated at Liege, 15th December, 1675u[8] , acquainting him with the death of Mr. LINUS of the epidemical disease, which then raged through so many countries, and with the resolution of Mr. LINUS'S disciples, to try Mr. NEWTON'S experiment concerning light and colours more clearly and carefully, and before more witnesses, according to the directions given them by Mr. NEWTON'S last letter: intimating withal, that if the said experiment be made before the Royal Society, and be attested by them to succeed, as Mr. NEWTON affirmed, they would rest satisfied.
It was ordered, that when the sun should serve, the experiment should be made before the Society.
Mr. AUBREY presented the Society with his observations made in Wiltshire, which being read, he was desired to endeavour to procure some of the iron-ore of Sein in that county, said to be so rich, that the smith could melt it in his forge: as also to procure from Easton-Peires in Malmesbury hundred, some of the blue clay, free from sand, and almost of the colour of ultramarine; which clay Mr. DOIGHT supposed to be very fit for porcelane.
The Society adjourned till the 13th of January following.
January 13. Captain HENRY SHEERES, JOHN MAPLETOFT, M. D.x[9] , and Signor FRANCISCO TRAVAGINI were proposed candidates, the first in the name of Sir JOSEPH WILLIAMSON, the second by Mr. HOOKE, and the third by Mr. OLDENBURG.
Mr. NEWTON'S experiment of glass rubbed, to cause various motions in bits of paper underneath, being made according to his more particular directions, succeeded very well. The rubbing was made both with a scrubbing brush, made of short hog's bristles, with a knife, the haft of the knife made of whalebone, and with the nail of one's finger. It appeared, that touching many parts at once with a hard and rough body, produced the effect expected.
It was ordered, that Mr. NEWTON should have the thanks of the Society, for giving himself the trouble of imparting to them such full instructions for making the experiment.
Mr. OLDENBURG produced and read a Latin letter of Mr. FLAMSTEAD to Sir JONAS MOORE, dated at Greenwich, 24th December, 1675y[10] , containing an account of his observations made of the late eclipse of the moon on the 21st December, p, m.
<272>
It was ordered, that Mr. OLDENBURG should be desired, according to the motion made by Mr. FLAMSTEAD, to impart these obesrvations to Signor CASSINI at Paris, and to desire him to communicate to the Society his observations on the same eclipse.
Mr. OLDENBURG produced likewise some papers of Mr. AUBREY, containing his observations of the county of Surry. But the time being elapsed, these papers were referred to the next meeting
January 20. Mr. AUBREY'S papers of observation on Surrey were read.
There was also read the beginning of Mr. NEWTON'S discourse, containing such observations, as conduce to further discoveries for completing his theory of light and colours, especially as to the constitution of natural bodies, on which their colours or transparency depend: in which he describes first the principal of his observations, and then considers and makes use of them.
At this time there were read the first fifteen of those observations as followz[11] :
I suppose you understand, that all transparent substances (as glass, water, air &c.) when made very thin by being blown into bubbles, or otherwise formed into plates, do exhibit various colours, according to their various thinness, although at a greater thickness they appear very clear and colourless. In my former discourse about the constitution of light, I omitted these colours, because they seemed of a difficult consideration, and were not necessary for the establishing of the doctrine, which I propounded; but because they may conduce to further discoveries for compleating that theory, especially as to the constitution of the parts of natural bodies, on which their colours or transparency depend, I have now sent you an account of them. To render this discourse short and distinct, I have first described the principal of my observations, and then considered and made use of them. The observations are these:
Obs. 1. Compressing two prisms hard together, that their sides (which by chance were a very little convex) might somewhere touch one another, I found the place, in which they touched, to becomea[12] absolutely transparent, as if they had been there one continued piece of glass; for when the light fell so obliquely on the air, which in other places was between them, as to be all reflected, in that place of contact it seemed wholly transmitted; insomuch that when looked upon, it appeared like a black or dark spot, by reason of no sensible light was reflected from thence, as from other places; and when looked through, it seemed, as it were, a hole in that air, that was formed into a thin <273> plate by being compressed between the glasses; and through this hole objects, that were beyond, might be seen distinctly, which could not at all be seen through other parts of the glasses, where the air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex, yet this transparent spot was of a considerable breadth, which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yielding inwards of the parts of the glasses by reason of their mutual pressure; for by pressing them very hard together, it would become much broader than otherwise.
Obs. 2. When the plate of air, by turning the prisms about their common axis, became so little inclined to the incident rays, that some of them began to be transmitted, there arose in it many slender arcs of colours, which at first were shaped almost like the conchoid, as you see them here delineated. And by continuing the motion of the prisms, these arcs increased and bended more and more about the said transparent spot, till they were compleated into circles or rings incompassing it, and afterwards continually grew more and more contracted.
These arcs, at their first appearance, were of a violet and blue colour, and between them were white arcs of circles, which presently became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red and yellow, and to their outward limbs the blue was adjacent; so that the order of these colours from the central dark spot, was at that time white, blue, violet, black, red, orange, yellow, white, blue, violet, &c. but the yellow and red were much fainter than the blue and violet.
The motion of the prisms about their axis being continued, these colours contracted more and more, shrinking towards the whiteness on either side of it, until they totally vanished into it; and then the circles in those parts appeared black, and white, without any other colours intermixed; but by further moving the prisms about, the colours again emerged out of the whiteness, the violet and blue at its inward limb, and at its outward limb the red and yellow; so that now their order from the central spot was white, yellow, red, black, violet, blue, white, yellow, red &c. contrary to what it was before.
Obs. 3. When the rings or some parts appeared only black and white, they were very distinct and well defined, and the blackness seemed as intense as that of the central spot; also, in the borders of these rings, where the colours began to emerge out of the whiteness, they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty successions (reckoning every black and white ring for one succession) and seen more of them, which by reason of their smallness I could not number. But in other positions of the prisms, at which the rings appeared of many colours, I could not distinguish above eight or nine of them, and the exterior of those too were confused and dilute.
<274>
In these two observations, to see the rings distinct, and without any other colour but black and white, I found it necesary that I held my eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye, yet there emerged a bluish colour out of the white, which by dilating itself more and more into a black, rendered the circles less distinct, and left the white a little tinged with red and yellow. I found also, that by looking through a slit or oblong hole, which was narrower than the pupil of my eye, and held close to it parallel to the prisms, I could see the circles much distincter and visible to a far greater number than otherwise.
Obs. 4. To observe more nicely the order of the colours, which arose out of the white circles, as the rays became less and less inclined to the plate of air; I took two object-glasses, the one a plane-convex for a fourteen foot telescope, and the other a large double convex for one of fifty foot; and upon this laying the other with its plane side downwards, I pressed them slowly together, to make the colours successively emerge in the middle of the circles, and then slowly lifted the upper glass from the lower, to make them successively vanish again in the same place, where being of a considerable breadth, I could more easily discern them. And by this means I observed their succession and quantity to be as followeth.
Next to the pellucid central spot made by the contact of the glasses, succeeded violet, blue, white, yellow, and red. The violet and blue were so very little in quantity, that I could not discern them in the circles made by the prisms; but the yellow and red were pretty copious, and seemed about as much in extent as the white, and four or five times more than the blue and violet. The next circuit or order of colours immediately encompassing these was violet, blue, green, yellow, and red. And these were all of them copious and vivid, excepting the green, which was very little in quantity, and seemed much more faint and dilute than the other colours. Of the other four the violet was least, and the blue less than the yellow or red. The third circuit or order was also purple, blue, green, yellow, and red, in which the purple seemed more reddish than the violet in the former circuit, and the green was much more conspicuous, being as brisk and copious as any of the other colours except the yellow; but the red began to be a little faded, inclining very much to purple. After these succeeded green and red: the green was very copious and lively, inclining on the one side to blue, and the other to yellow. But in this fourth circuit there was neither violet, blue, nor yellow, and the red was very imperfect and dirty. Also the succeeding colours became more and more imperfect and dilute, till after three or four more revolutions they ended in perfect whiteness.
Obs. 5. To determine the interval of the glasses, or thickness of the interjacent air, by which each colour was produced; I measured the diameter of the first six rings at the most lucid part of their orbits, and squaring them I found their squares to be in arithmetical progression of the odd numbers, 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. And since one of the glasses was plane and the other spherical, their <275> intervals at those rings must be in the same progression. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint rings between the more lucid colours, and found their squares to be in arithmetical progression, of the even numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12; and it being very nice and difficult to take these measures exactly, I repeated them divers times, at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them; and the same method I used in determining some others of the following obseravtions.
Obs. 6. The diameter of the first ring, at the most lucid part of its orbit, was parts of an inch, and the diameter of the sphere, on which the double convex object-glass was ground, was an hundred and two foot, as I found by measuring it; and consequently the thickness of the air, or aereal interval of the glasses at that ring, was  of an inch. For as the diameter of the said sphere (an hundred and two foot, or twelve hundred and twenty-four inches) is to the semidiameter of the ring , so very nearly is that semidiameter to , the said distance of the glasses. Now, by the precedent observations, the eleventh part of this distance () is the thickness of the air at that part of the first ring, where the yellow would be most vivid, were it not mixed with other colours in the white; and this doubled gives the difference of its thickness at the yellow in all the other rings, viz. , or, to use a round number, the eighty thousand part of an inch.
Obs. 7. These dimensions were taken, when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses, in or near the axis of the rings; but when I viewed them obliquely, they became bigger, continually swelling as I removed my eye farther from their axis; and partly by measuring the diameter of the same circle at several obliquities of my eye, partly by other means; as also by making use of the two prisms for very great obliquities, I found its diameter, and consequently the thickness of the air at its perimeter in all those obliquities, to be very nearly in the proportions expressed in this table.

In the first two columns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the plate of air; that is, their angles of incidence and refraction. In the third column, the diameter of any coloured ring of those obliquities is expressed in parts, of which ten constitute that diameter, when the rays are perpendicular. And in the fourth column the thickness of the air at the circumference of that ring is expressed in parts, of which also ten constitute that thickness, when the rays are perpendicular.
Obs. 8. The dark spot in the middle of the rings increased also by that obliquation of the eye, although almost insensibly. But, if instead of the object-glasses, the prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest, when viewed so obliquely, that no colours appeared about it. It was least, when the rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent air, and increased more and more, until the coloured rings appeared, and then decreased again, but not so much as it increased before. And hence it is evident, that the transparency was not only at the absolute contact of the glasses, but also where they had some little interval. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between half and two fifth parts of the diameter of the exterior circumference of the red in the first circuit or revolution of colours, when viewed almost perpendicularly; whereas, when viewed obliquely, it hath wholly vanished, and become opake and white, like the other parts of the glass. Whence it may be collected, that the glasses did then scarcely, or not at all, touch one another; and that their interval of the perimeter of that spot, when viewed perpendicularly, was about a fifth or sixth part of their interval at the circumference of the said red.
Obs. 9. By looking through the two contiguous object-glasses, I found, that the interjacent air exhibited rings of colours, as well by transmitting light as by reflecting it. The central spot was now white, and from it the order of the colours were yellowish, red, black, violet, blue, white, yellow, red; violet, blue, green, yellow, red, &c. but these colours were very faint and dilute, unless when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses; for by that means they became pretty vivid, only the first yellowish red, like the blue in the fourth observation, was so little and faint as scarcely to be discerned. Comparing the coloured rings made by reflection with these made by transmission of the light, I found, that white was opposite to black, red to blue, yellow to violet, and green to a compound of red and violet; that is, those parts of the glass were black when, looked through, which when looked upon appeared white, and on the contrary; and so those, which in one case exhibited blue, did in the other case exhibit red; and the like of the other colours.
Obs. 10. Wetting the object-glass a little at their edges, the water crept in slowly between them, and the circles thereby became less, and the colours more faint; insomuch that, as the water crept along, one half of them, at which it first arrived, would appear broken off from the other half, and contracted into a less room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by air, to be about seven to eight; <277> and consequently the intervals of the glasses at like circles, caused by these two mediums, water and air, are as about three to four. Perhaps it may be a general rule, that if any other medium, more or less dense than water, be compressed between the glasses, their interval at the rings, caused thereby, will be to their interval, caused by interjacent air, as the sines are, which measure the refraction made out of that medium into air.
Obs. 11. When the water was between the glasses, if I pressed the upper glass variously at its edges to make the rings move nimbly from one place to another, a little bright spot would immediately follow the center of them, which, upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place, would presently vanish. Its appearance was such, as interjacent air would have caused, and it exhibited the same colours; but it was not air, for where any aereal bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflection must rather have been caused by a subtiler medium, which could recede through the glass at the creeping in of the water.
Obs. 12. These observations were made in the open air. But further, to examine the effects of coloured light falling on the glasses, I darkened the room, and viewed them by reflection of the colours of a prism cast on a sheet of white paper; and by this means the rings became distincter, and visible to a far greater number than in the open air.
I have seen more than twenty of them, whereas in the open air I could not discern above eight or nine.
Obs. 13. Appointing an assistant to move the prism to and fro about its axis, that all its colours might successively fall on the same place of the paper, and be reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles, which the red light made, to be manifestly bigger than those, which were made by the blue and violet; and it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract, accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The interval of the glass at any of the rings, when they were made by the utmost red light, was to their interval at the same ring, when made by the utmost violet, greater than three to two, and less than thirteen to eight. By the most of my observations it was as nine to fourteen. And this proportion seemed very nearly the same in all obliquities of my eye, unless when two prisms were made use of instead of the object-glasses: for then, at a certain great obliquity, the rings made by the several colours seemed equal; and, at a greater obliquity, those made by the violet would be greater than the same rings made by the red.
Obs. 14. While the prism was turned about uniformly, the contraction or dilation of a ring made by alll the several colours of the prism successively reflected from the object-glasses, was swiftest in the red, slowest in the violet, and in intermediate colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. Comparing the extent, which each colour obtained by this contraction or {dilation,} I found, <278> that the blue was sensibly more extended than the violet, the yellow than the blue, and the red than the yellow. And, to make a juster estimation of their proportions, I observed, that the extent of the red was almost double to that of the violet, and that the light was of a middle colour between yellow and green at that interval of the glasses, which was an arithmetical mean between the two extremes; contrary to what happens in the colours made by the refraction of a prism, where the red is most contracted, the violet most expanded, and in the midst of them is the confine of green and blue.
Obs. 15. These rings were not of various colours, like those in the open air, but appeared all over of that prismatic colour only, with which they were illuminated: and, by projecting the prismatic colours immediately upon the glasses, I found, that the light, which fell on the dark spaces, which were between the coloured rings, was transmitted through the glasses without any variation of colour. For, on a white paper placed behind, it would paint rings of the same colour with those, which were reflected, and of the bigness of their intermediate spaces. And from hence the origin of these rings is manifest, namely, that the aereal interval of the glasses, according to its various thickness, is disposed in some places to reflect, and in others to transmit, the light of any colour; and, in the same place to reflect one colour, where it transmits another.
These observations so well pleased the Society, that they ordered Mr. OLDENBURG to desire Mr. NEWTON to permit them to be published, together with the rest; which, they presumed, did correspond with those, that had been now read to them.
Besides, there was read a passage of Mr. NEWTON'S letter to Mr. OLDENBURG, of 21 December, 1675, stating the difference between his hypothesis and that of Mr. HOOKE. Which passage was as follows:
As for Mr. HOOKE'S insinuation, that the sum of the hypothesis I sent you had been delivered by him in his Micrography, I need not much be concerned at the liberty he takes in that kind: yet, because you think it may do well, if I state the difference I take to be between them, I shall do it as briefly as I can, and that the rather, that I may avoid the favour of having done any thing unjustifiable or unhandsome towards Mr. HOOKE. But, for this end, I must first (to see what is his) cast out what he has borrowed from DES CARTES, or others, viz. that there is an æthereal medium; that light is the action of this medium; that this medium is less implicated in the parts of solid bodies, and so moves more freely in them, and transmits light more readily through them, and that after such a manner, as to accelerate the rays in a certain proportion; that refraction arises from this acceleration, and has sines proportional; that light is at first uniform; that its colours are some disturbance or new modification of its rays by refraction or reflection; that the colours of a prism are made by means of the quiescent medium, accelerating some motion of the rays on one side, where red appears, and retarding it on <279> the other side, where blue appears; and, that there are but these two original colours, or colour-making modifications of light, which by their various degrees, or, as Mr. HOOKE calls it, dilutings, produce all intermediate ones. This rejected, the remainder of his hypothesis is, that he has changed DES CARTES'S pressing or progressive motion of the medium to a vibrating one, the rotation of the globuli to the obligation of pulses, and the accelerating their rotation on the one hand, and retarding it on the other, by the quiescent medium, to produce colours, to the like action of the medium on the two ends of his pulses for the same end. And having thus far modified his by the Cartesian hypothesis, he has extended it further, to explicate the phænomena of thin plates, and added another explication of the colours of natural bodies, fluid and solid.
This, I think, is in short the sum of his hypothesis; and in all this I have nothing in common with him, but the supposition, that æther is a susceptible medium of vibrations, of which supposition I make a very different use; he supposing it a light itself, which I suppose it is not. This is as great a difference as is between him and DES CARTES. But besides this, the manner of refraction and reflection, and the nature and production of colours in all cases (which takes up the body of my discourse) I explain very differently from him; and even in the colours of thin transparent substances, I explain every thing after a way so differing from him, that the experiments I ground my discourse on, destroy all he has said about them; and the two main experiments, without which the manner of the production of those colours is not to be found out, were not only unknown to him, when he wrote his Micrography, but even last spring, as I understood, in mentioning them to him. This therefore is the sum of what is common to us, that æther may vibrate; and so, if he thinks fit to use that notion of colours, arising from the various bigness of pulses (without which his hypothesis will do nothing) his will borrow as much from my answer to his objections, as that I send you does from his Micrography.
But, it may be, he means, that I have made use of his observations, and of some I did; as, that of the inflection of rays, for which I quoted him; that of opacity, arising from the interstices of the parts of bodies, which I insist not on; and that of plated bodies exhibiting colours, a phænomenon, for the notice of which I thank him. But he left me to find out and make such experiments about it, as might inform me of the manner of the production of those colours, to ground an hypothesis on; he having given no further insight to it than this, that the colour depended on some certain thickness of the plate; though what that thickness was at every colour, he confesses in his Micrography, he had attempted in vain to learn; and therefore, seeing I was left to measure it myself, I suppose he will allow me to make use of what I took the pains to find out. And this I hope may vindicate me from what Mr. HOOKE has been pleased to charge me with.
The reading of the rest of Mr. NEWTON'S discourse was referred to the next meeting.
<280>
January 27. Mr. OLDENBURG produced from his highness prince RUPERT a piece of marble, having several pictures of boys and trees painted upon it in such a manner, that all the out-lines of the pictures were exactly defined without any flowing of the colours abroad, and the colours fixed by the fire, and afterwards so polished, that they would be permanent, and last as long as the marble.
This was acknowledged by the members to be a very great improvement of what had been done at Oxford by a certain stone-cutter there; and that all, that had been performed before in this art, was not comparable to this degree of improvement.
Mr. HOOKE remarked, that he conceived, that there were but two colours in this piece; and that he had a method of doing it with most colours, and to paint with them upon marble almost as curiously as with a pencil.
Mr. NEWTON'S letter of January 25, 167c[13] , in which he acknowledged the favour of the Society in their kind acceptance of his late papers; and declared, that he knew not how to deny any thing, which they desired should be done: but he requested, that the printing of his observations about colours might be suspended for a time, because he had some thoughts of writing such another set of observations for determining the manner of the production of colours by the prism: which observations, he said, ought to precede those now in the Society's possession, and would be most proper to be joined with them.
There was also read a letter of Mr. PASCALL of Somersetshire to Mr. AUBREY, dated 18 January 167, containing some natural observations of that county, viz. concerning the nature of the lead-mines in Mendip-Hills; a well resembling the sulphur-well near the Spaw in Yorkshire; a spring petrifying far more than the dropping-well at Knaresborough in the north; the motion of some underground waters in the parishes of ZOLANDE, formerly recovered from the sea &c.
It was ordered, that the reading of Mr. NEWTON'S observations about colours be continued at the next meeting.
February 3. There was presented from Dr. WALLIS his edition of ARCHIMEDES'S Arenarius, with a new translation of his and notes, printed at Oxford, in 1676.
The reading of Mr. NEWTON'S observations on colours was continued, viz. that part, wherein he explains by the simplest of colours the most recompounded; as follows:
Obs. 16. The squares of the diameters of these rings, made by prismatic colour, were in arithmetical progression, as in the fifth observation. And the diameter of the sixth circle, when made by the yellow, and viewed almost perpendicularly, was about  parts of an inch, agreeable to the sixth observation.
<281>
The precedent observations were made with a rarer thin medium terminated by a denser, such as was air or water compressed betwixt two glasses. In those, that follow, are set down the appearances of a denser medium thinned within a rarer; such as are the plates of Muscovy-glass, bubbles of water, and some others thin substances terminated on all sides with air.
Obs. 17. If a bubble be blown with water, first made tenacious by dissolving a little soap in it, it is a common observation, that after a while it will appear tinged with a great variety of colours. To defend these bubbles from being agitated by the external air (whereby their colours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no accurate observation can be made of them) as soon as I had blown any of them, I covered it with a clear glass, and by that means its colours emerged in a very regular order, like so many concentric rings incompassing the top of the bubble. And as the bubble grew thinner by the continual subsiding of the water, these rings dilated slowly, and overspread the whole bubble, descending in order to the bottom of it, where they vanished successively. In the mean while, after all the colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the center of the rings a small, round, black spot, like that in the first observation, which continually dilated itself, till it became sometimes more than one half or three fourths of an inch in breadth, before the bubble broke. At first I thought there had been no light reflected from the water in that place; but observing it more curiously, I saw within it several smaller, round spots, which appeared much blacker and darker than the rest, whereby I knew, that there was some reflection at the other places, which were not so dark as those spots. And by further trial I found, that I could see the images (as of a candle or the sun) very faintly reflected, not only from the great black spot, but also from the little darker spots, which were within it.
Besides the aforesaid coloured rings, there would often appear small spots of colours ascending and descending up and down the side of the bubble, by reason of some inequalities in the subsiding of the water; and sometimes small black spots generated at the sides, would ascend up to the larger black spot at the top of the bubble, and unite with it.
Obs. 18. Because the colours of these bubbles were more extended and lively than those of air thinned between two glasses, and so more easy to be distinguished, I shall here give you a further description of their order, as they were observed in viewing them by reflection of the skies, when of a white colour, whilst a black substance was placed behind the bubble: and they were these; red, blue, red, blue; red, blue; red, green; red, yellow; green, blue, purple; red, yellow, green, blue, violet; red, yellow, white, blue, black.
The three first successions of red and blue were very dilute and dirty, especially the first, where the red seemed in a manner to be white. Amongst these there was scarcely any other colour sensible, only the blues (and principally the second blue) inclined a little to green.
<282>
The fourth red was also dilute and dirty, but not so much as the former three: after that succeeded little or no yellow, but a copious green, which at first was inclined a little to yellow, and then became a pretty brisk and good willow green, and afterwards changed to a blueish colour; but there succeded neither blue nor violet.
The fifth red at first was very much inclined to purple, and afterwards became more bright and brisk, but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with a very bright and intense yellow, which was but little in quantity, and soon changed to green; but that green was copious, and something more pure, deep, and lively, than the former green. After that followed an excellent blue of a bright sky colour; and then a purple, which was less in quantity than the blue, and much inclined to red.
The sixth red was at first of a very fair and lively scarlet, and soon after of a brighter colour, being very pure and brisk, and the best of all the reds. Then, after a lively orange, followed an intense, bright, and copious yellow, which was also the best of all the yellows; and this changed, first to a greenish yellow, and then to a greenish blue; but the green between the yellow and blue was very little and dilute, seeming rather a greenish white than a green. The blue, which succeeded, became very good, and of a fair, bright, sky colour; but yet something inferior to the former blue: and the violet was intense and deep, with little or no redness in it, and less in quantity than the blue.
In the last red appeared a tincture of scarlet next the violet, which soon changed to a brighter colour, inclining to an orange: and the yellow, which followed, was at first pretty good and lively, but afterwards it grew more and more dilute, until by degrees it ended in perfect whiteness: and this whiteness, if the water was very tenacious and well tempered, would slowly spread and dilate itself over the greatest part of the bubble, continually growing paler at the top, where at length it would crack, and those cracks, as they dilated, would appear of a pretty good, but yet obscure and dark, sky-colour; the white between the blue spots diminishing, until it resembled the threads of an irregular net-work, and soon after vanished and left all the upper part of the bubble of the said dark blue colour; and this colour, after the aforesaid manner, dilated itself downwards, until sometimes it hath overspread the whole bubble. In the mean while, at the top, which was of a darker blue than the bottom, and appeared also of many round blue spots, something darker than the rest, there would emerge one or more very black spots, and within those, other spots of an intenser blackness, which I mentioned in the former observation; and those continually dilated themselves until the bubble broke.
If the water was not very tenacious, the black spots would break forth in the white, without any sensible intervention of the blue: and sometimes they would break forth within the precedent yellow, or red, or perhaps within the blue of the second order, before the intermediate colours had time to display themselves.
<283>
By this description you may perceive, how great an affinity these colours have with those of air, described in the fourth observation, although set down in a contrary order, by reason that they begin to appear, when the bubble is thickest, and are most conveniently reckoned from the lowest and thickest part of the bubble upwards.
Obs. 19. Viewing, at several oblique positions of my eye, the rings of colours emerging on the top of the bubble, I found, that they were sensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity, but yet not so much by far, as those made by thinned air in the seventh observation. For there they distended so much, as, when viewed most obliquely, to arrive at a part of the plate more than twelve lines thicker than that where they appeared, when viewed perpendicularly; whereas in this case the thickness of the water, at which they arrived when viewed most obliquely, was, to that thickness, which exhibited them by perpendicular rays, something less than eight to five. By the best of my observations, it was between fifteen and fifteen and a half to ten, an increase about twenty-four times less than in the other case.
Sometimes the bubble would become of an uniform thickness all over, except at the top of it near the black spot, as I knew, because it would exhibit the same appearance of colours in all positions of the eye; and then the colours, which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays, would be different from those, that were seen in other places by rays less oblique to it. And divers spectators might see the same part of it by differing colours, by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now, observing how much the colours at the same place of the bubble, or at divers places of equal thickness, were varied by the several obliquities of the rays, by assistance of the fourth, fourteenth, sixteenth, and eighteenth onservations, as they are hereafter explained, I collected the thickness of the water, requisite to exhibit any one the same colour at several obliquities, to be very nearly in the proportion expressed in this table.

In the two first columns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the superficies of the water; that is, their angles of incidence and refraction; where, I suppose, that the lines, which measure them, are in round numbers, as three to four, though probably the dissolution of soap in the water may a little alter its refractive virtue. In the third column the thickness of the bubble, <284> at which any one colour is exhibited in those several obliquities, is exprest in parts, of which ten constitute that thickness, when the rays are perpendicular.
I have sometimes observed of the colours, which arise on polished steel by heating it, or on bell metal and some other metalline substances, when melted and poured on the ground, where it may cool in the open air, that they have, like those of water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers obliquities; and particularly, that a deep blue or violet, when viewed very obliquely, hath been changed to a deep red. But the changes of these colours are not so sensible as of those made by water; for the scoria, or vitrified part of the metal, which most metals, when heated or melted, continually protrude to their surface, where, by covering them in form of a thin glassy skin, it causes these colours, is much denser than water, and I find, that the change made by the obliquation of the eye, is least in colours of the densest thin substances.
Obs. 20. As in the ninth observation, so here, the bubble, by transmitted light appeared of a contrary colour to that, which it exhibited by reflection.Thus, when the bubbles, being looked on by the light of the clouds reflected from it, seemed red at its apparent circumference, if the clouds at the same time, or very suddenly, were viewed through it, the colour at its circumference would be blue. And, on the contrary, when by reflected light it appeared blue, it would appear red by transmitted light.
Obs. 21. By wetting plates of Muscovy-glass, whose thinness made the like colours appear, the colours became more faint, especially by wetting the plates on that side opposite the eye; but I could not perceive any variation of their species. So that the thickness of a plate requisite to produce any colour, depends only on the density of the plate, and not of the ambient medium. And hence, by the tenth and sixteenth observations, may be known the thickness of bubbles of water or plates of Muscovy-glass, or of any other substances, which they have at any colour produced by them.
Obs. 22. A thin transparent body, which is denser than its ambient medium, exhibits more brisk and vivid colours than that, which is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in air and glass: for, blowing glass very thin at a lamp furnace, those plates encompassed with air did exhibit colours much more vivid than those of air made thin between two glasses.
Obs. 23. Comparing the quantity of light reflected from the several rings, I found it was most copious from the first or inmost, and in the exterior rings became gradually less and less. Also the whiteness of the first ring was stronger than that reflected from those parts of the thinned medium, which were without the rings, as I could manifestly perceive by viewing at distance the rings made by the two object glasses; or by comparing two bubbles of water blown at distant times, in the first of which the whiteness appeared, which succeeded the colours, and the whiteness, which preceded them, in the other.
<285>
Obs. 24. When the two object-glasses were laid upon one another, so as to make the rings of colours appear, though with my naked eye I could not discern above eight or nine of those rings, yet, by viewing them through a prism, I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch, that I could number more than forty, besides many others, that were so very small and close together, that I could not keep my eye so steady on them severally as to number them: but by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more than a hundred. And, I believe, the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers; for they seem to be really unlimited, though visible only so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter explain.
But it was but one side of these rings, namely, that, towards which the refraction was made, which by that refraction was rendered distinct; and the other side became more confused than to the naked eye, insomuch that there I could not discern above one or two, and sometimes none of those rings, of which I could discern eight or nine with my naked eye. And their segments, or arcs, which on the other side appeared so numerous, for the most part exceeded not the third part of a circle. If the refraction was very great, or the prisms very distant from the object-glasses, the middle part of those arcs became also confused, so as to disappear and constitue an even whiteness, whilst on either side their ends, as also the whole arcs farthest from the center, became distincter than before, appearing in the form you see them here designed.
The arcs, where they seemed distinctest, were only white and black successively, without any other colours intermixed. But in other places there appeared colours whose order was inverted by the refraction, in such manner, that, if I first held the prism very near the object-glasses, and then gradually removed it farther off towards my eye, the colours of the second, third, fourth, and following rings shrunk towards the white, that emerged between them, until they wholly vanished into it at the middle of the arcs, and afterwards emerged again in a contrary order: but at the end of the arcs they retained their order unchanged.
I have sometimes so laid one object-glass upon the other, that, to the naked eye, they have all over seemed uniformly white, without the least appearance of any of the coloured rings; and yet, by viewing them through a prism, great multitudes of those rings have discovered themselves. And, in like manner, plates of Muscovy glass, and bubbles of glass blown at a lamp furnace, which were not so thin, as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the prism exhibited a great variety of them, ranged irregularly up and down, in the form of waves. And so bubbles of water, before they began to exhibit their colours to the naked eye of a by-stander, have appeared, through a prism, girded about with many parallel and horizontal rings; to produce which effect, it was necessary to hold the prism parallel, or very nearly parallel, to the horizon, and to dispose it so, that the rays might be refracted upwards.
<286>
Having given my observations of these colours, before I make use of them to unfold the causes of the colours of natural bodies, it is convenient, that, by the simplest of them, I first explain the more compounded; such as are the second, third, fourth, ninth, twelfth, eighteenth, twentieth, and twenty-fourth.
And first, to show how the colours in the fourth and eighteenth observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line the lengths Y Z, Y A, and Y H, in proportion as four, nine, and fourteen; and between Z A and Z H eleven mean proportionals, of which let Z B be the second, Z C the third, Z D the fifth, Z E the seventh, Z F the ninth, and Z G the tenth. And at the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, let perpendiculars A α, B β, &c. be erected, by whose intervals, the extent of the several colours set underneath against them, is to be represented. Then divide the line A α in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3; 5, 6, 7; 9, 10, 11, &c. set at the point of division denote. And through those divisions from Y draw lines 1 I, 2 K, 3 L; 5 m, 6 n, 7 o, &c.
Now, if A 2 be supposed to represent the thickness of any thin transparent body, at which the utmost violet is most copiously reflected in the first ring or series of colours, then, by the thirteenth observation, H K will represent its thickness, at which the utmost red is most copiously reflected in the same series. Also, by the fifth and sixteenth observations, A 6, and H n, will denote the thickness at which those extreme colours are most copiously reflected in the second series, and so on. And the thickness, at which any of the intermediate colours are reflected most copiously, will, according to the fourteenth observation, be defined by the in <287> termediate parts of the lines 2 K, 6 n, &c. against which the names of those colours are written below.
But farther, to define the latitude of these colours in each ring or series, let A 1 design the least thickness, and A 3 the greatest thickness, at which the extreme violet in the first series is reflected; and let H I and H L design the like limit for the extreme red, and the intermediate colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the lines, 1 I and 3 L; against which the names of those colours are written. And in the second series, let those limits be the lines 5 M and 7 O; and so on: but yet with this caution, that the reflections be supposed strongest at the intermediate spaces, 2 K, 6 N, 10 R, &c. and to decrease gradually towards these limits, 1 I, 3 L; 5 M, 7 O, &c. on either side, where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited, but to decay indefinitely. And whereas I have designed the same latitude to every series, I did it, because, although the colours in the first series seem to be a little broader than the rest, by reason of a stronger reflection there; yet that inequality is so insensible as scarcely to be determined by observation.
Now, according to this description, conceiving, that the rays, in which several colours in here, are by turns reflected at the space 1 K, 3 L, 5 M, O 7, 9 P, R 11, &c. and transmitted at the spaces A H I 1, 3 L, M 5, 7 O, P 9, &c. it is easy to know what colour in the open air must be exhibited at any thickness of a transparent thin body. For, if a ruler be applied parallel to A H, at that distance from it by which the thickness of the body is represented, the alternate spaces 1 I, L 3, 5 M, O 7, &c. which it crosseth, will denote the reflected original colours, of which the colour exhibited in the open air is compounded. Thus, if the constitution of the green in the third series of colours be desired; apply the ruler, as you see, at π ρ σ φ, and by its passing through some of the blue at π, and yellow at σ, as well as through the green ρ, you may conclude, that green, exhibited at that thickness of the body, is principally constituted of original green, but not without a mixture of some blue and yellow. By this means you may know, how the colours from the center of the rings outwards ought to succeed in order, as they were described in the fourth and eighteenth observations: for, if you move the ruler gradually from A H through all distances, having past over the first space, which denotes little or no reflection to be made by thinnest substances, it will first arrive at 1, the violet, and then very quickly at the blue and green, which, together with that violet compounded blue, and then at the yellow and red, by whose further addition, that blue is converted into whiteness, which whiteness continues during the transit from I to 3; and after that, by the successive deficience of its component colours, turns first to compound yellow, and then to red, and last of all the red ceaseth at L Then begin the colours of the second series, which succeed in order between 5 and O, and are more lively than before, because more expanded and severed. And, for the same reason, instead of the former white, there intercedes between the blue and yellow a mixture of orange, yellow, green, blue and indico, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute and imperfect green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in <288> order; first the violet, which a little interferes with the red of the second order, and is thereby inclined to a redish purple; then the blue and green, which are less mixed with other colours, and consequently more lively than before, especially the green. Then follows the yellow, some of which towards the green is distinct and good; but that part of it towards the succeeding red, as also that red, is mixed with the violet and blue of the fourth series, whereby various degrees of red, very much inclining to purple, are compounded. The violet and blue, which should succeed this red, being mixed with, and hidden in it, there succeeds a green; and this at first is much inclined to blue, but soon decomes a good green; the only unmixed and lively colour in this fourth series: for as it verges towards the yellow, it begins to interfere with the colours of the fifth series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow and red are very much diluted, and made dirty, especially the yellow, which being the weaker colour, is scarce able to shew itself. After this the several series interfere more and more, and their colours become more and more intermixed, till after three or four revolutions (in which the red and blue predominate by turns) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended, and compound one even whiteness.
And since, by the fifteenth observation, the rays indued with one colour are transmitted, where those of another colour are reflected, the reason of the colours made by the transmitted light, in the ninth and twentieth observations, is also from hence evident.
If not only the order and species of these colours, but also the precise thickness of the plate, or thin body, at which they are exhibited, be desired in parts of an inch, that may be also performed by assistance of the sixth or sixteenth observation. For, according to those observations, the thickness of the thinned air, which, between two glasses, exhibited the orange or bright red of the sixth order, was  parts of an inch. Now, suppose this thickness be represented by G τ, and the eleventh part of it, G λ, will be about  of an inch. And so G μ, G V, G ξ, G o, will be , , , and . And this being known, it is easy to determine what thickness of air is represented by G φ, or any other distance of the ruler from A H.
But further, since, by the tenth observation, the thickness of air was to the thickness of water, which between the same glasses exhibited the same colour, as four to three; and, by the twenty-first observation, the colours of thin bodies are not varied by varying the ambient medium; the thickness of a bubble of water exhibiting any colour will be three fourths of the thickness of air producing the same colour. And so, according to the same tenth and twenty-first observations, the thickness of a plate of glass, whose refraction is measured by the proportion of the sines thirty-one to twenty, may be  of the thickness of air producing the same colours: and the like of other mediums. On these grounds I have composed the following table; wherein the thickness of air, water, and glass, at which each colour is most intense and specific, is expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand equal parts.
<289>
Now, if this table be compared with the third scheme, you will there see the constitution of each colour, as to its ingredients, or the original colours, of which it is compounded, and thence be enabled to judge of its intenseness or imperfection, which may suffice in explication of the fourth and eighteenth <290> observations, unless it be further desired to delineate the manner, how the colours appear, when the two object-glasses are laid upon one another: to do which let there be described a large arc of a circle and a strait line, which may touch that arc; are parallel to that tangent several occult lines at such distances from it, as the numbers set against the several colours in the table denote. For the arc and its tangent will represent the superficies of the glasses, terminating the interjacent air, and the places, where the occult lines cut the arc, will show at what distances from the center, or point of the contact, each colour is reflected.
There are also other uses for this table; for by its assistance the thickness of the bubble, in the nineteenth observation, was determined by the colours, which it exhibited. And so the bigness of the parts of natural bodies may be conjectured at by their colours, as shall be hereafter shown. Also, if two or more very thin plates be laid one upon another, so as to compose one plate, equalling them all in thickness, the resulting colour may be hereby determined. For instance, Mr. HOOKE, in his Micrographia, observes, that a faint yellow plate of Muscovy glass, laid upon a blue one, constituted a very deep purple. The yellow of the first order is a faint one, and the thickness of the plate exhibiting it, according to the table, is 5, to which add 9, the thickness exhibiting blue of the second order, and the sum will be 14 , which most nearly approaches 14, the thickness exhibiting the purple of the third order.
To explain, in the next place, the circumstances of the second and third observations, that is, how the colours (by turning the prisms about their common axis the contrary way to that expressed in those observations) may be converted into white and black rings, and afterwards into colours again in an inverted order; it must be remembered, that those colours are dilated by obliquation of the rays to the air, which intercedes the glasses; and that, according to the table in the seventh observation, their dilation or reflection from the common center is most manifest and speedy when they are obliquest. Now, the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first superficies of the said air than those of red, are thereby made more oblique to the second superficies, at which they are reflected, to produce the coloured rings; and consequently, the yellow in each ring will be more dilated than the red; and the excess of its dilation will be so much the greater, by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rays, until at last it become of equal extent with the red of the same ring. And, for the same reason, the green, blue, and violet, will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rays, as to become all very nearly of equal extent with the red; that is, equally distant from the center of the rings. And then all the colours of the same series must be coincident, and by their mixture exhibit a white ring; and these white rings must have black or dark rings between them, because they do not spread and interfere with one another as before; and, for that reason also, they must become distincter, and visible to far greater numbers. But yet the violet, being <291> obliquest, will be something more dilated in proportion than the other colours; and so very apt to appear at the exterior verges of the white.
Afterwards, by a greater obliquity of the rays, the violet and the blue become sensibly more dilated than the red and yellow; and so being further removed from the center of the rings, the colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the violet and blue at the exterior limbs, and the red and yellow at the interior. And the violet, by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rays, being, in proportion, most of all expanded, will soonest appear at the exterior limb of each white ring, and become more conspicuous than the rest. And the several series of colours, by their unfolding and spreading, will begin again to interfere, and thereby render the rings less distinct, and not visible to so great numbers.
If, instead of the prisms, the object-glasses be made use of, the rings, which they exhibit, become not white and distinct by the obliquity of the eye, by reason, that the rays, in their passage through that air, which interceded the glasses, are very nearly parallel to themselves, when first incident on the glasses; and consequently, those indued with several colours are not inclined one more than another to that air, as it happens in the prisms.
There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered; and that is, why the black and white rings, which, when viewed at a distance, appear distinct, should not only become confused by viewing them near at hand, but also yield a violet colour at both the edges of every white ring: and the reason is, that the rays, which enter the eye at several parts of the pupil, have several obliquities to the glasses, and those, which are most oblique, if considerd apart, would represent the rings bigger than those, which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the perimeter of every white ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays, and inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater, by how much the greater is the difference of the obliquity; that is, by how much the pupil is wider, or the eye nearer to the glasses: and the breadth of the violet must be most expanded, because the rays, apt to excite a sensation of that colour, are most oblique to the second or further superficies of the thinned air, at which they are reflected; and have also the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. And, as the breadth of every ring is thus augmented, the dark intervals must be diminished, until the neighbouring rings become continuous, and are blended, the exterior first, and then those nearer the center; so that they can no longer be distinguished a-part, but seem to constitute an even and uniform whiteness.
Amongst all the observations there is none accompanied with so odd circumstances as the twenty-fourth. Of those the principal are, that in thin plates, which, to the naked eye, seem of an even and uniform transparent whiteness, the refraction of a prism should make the rings of colours appear; whereas it usually makes objects to appear coloured only, where they are terminated with <292> shadows, or have parts unequally luminous; and that it should make those rings exceedingly distinct and white, although it usually renders those objects confused and coloured. The cause of these things you will understand by considering, that all the rings of colours are really in the plate, when viewed by the naked eye, although, by reason of the great breadth of their circumferences, they so much interfere, and are blended together, that they seem to constitute an even whiteness. But, when the rays pass through the prism to the eye, the orbits of the several colours in every ring are refracted, some more than others, according to their degree of refrangibility; by which means the colours on one side of the ring become more unfolded and dilated, and on the other side more complicated and contracted. And where, by a due refraction, they are so much contracted, that the several rings become narrower than to interfere with one another, they must appear distinct, and also white, if the constituent colours be so much contracted as to be wholly coincident: but on the other side, where every ring is made broader by the further unfolding its colours, it must interfere more with other rings than before, and so become less distinct.
To explain this a little further; suppose the concentric circles, A B and C D, represent the red and violet of any order, which, together with the intermediate colours, constitute any one of these rings. Now, these being viewed through a prism, the violet circle, B C, will, by a greater refraction, be further translated from its place than the red, A D, and so approach nearer to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance, if the red be translated to a d, the violet may be translated to b c, so as to approach nearer to it at c than before; and, if the red be further translated to a d, the violet may be so much further translated to b c, as to convene with it at c, and, if the red be yet further translated to α δ, the violet may be still so much further translated to β γ, as to pass beyond it at γ, and convene with it at e and f. And this being understood, not only of the red and the violet, but of all the intermediate colours; and also of every revolution of those colours, you will easily perceive, how these of the same revolution or order, by their narrowness at c d, and δ γ, and their coincidence at c d, e and f, ought to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles, especially at c d, or at e and f, and that they will appear several at c d, at c d exhibit whiteness by their coincidence, and again appear several at δ γ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before, and still retain beyond e and f. But, on the other side, at a b, a b, or α β, these colours must become much more confused by being dilated, and spread so as to interfere with those of other orders. And the same confusion will happen at δ γ between e and f, if the refraction be <293> very great, or the prism very distant from the object-glasses; in which case no parts of the ring will be seen, save only two little arcs at e and f, whose distance from one another will be augmented by removing the prism still further from the object-glasses. And these little arcs must be distinctest and whitest at their middle; and at their ends, where they grow confused, they must be coloured; and the colours at one end of every arc must be in a contrary order to those at the other end, by reason that they cross in the intermediate white; namely, their ends, which verge towards δ γ, will be red, and yellow on that side next the center, and blue and violet on the other side. But their other ends, which verge from δ γ, will, on the contrary, be blue and violet on that side towards the center, and on the other side red and yellow.
For confirmation of all this, I need to alledge no more, than that it is mathematically demonstrable from my former principles. But I shall add, that they, which please to take the prisms, may be the testimony of their senses be assured, that these explications are not hypothetical, but infallibly true and genuine: for in a dark room, by viewing these rings through a prism, by reflection of the several prismatic colours, which an assistant causes to move to and fro upon a wall or paper, from whence they are reflected, whilst the spectator's eye, the prism, and object-glasses (as in the thirteenth observation) are placed steddy, the position of the circles, made successively by the several colours, will be found such, in respect of one another, as I have described at a b c d, or a b c d, or α β γ δ. And by the same method the truth of the explications of the other observations is to be examined.
By what hath been said, the like phænomena of water-bubbles and thin plates of glass may be understood. But in small fragments of those plates, there is this further observable, that, if they, lying flat upon a table, be turned about their center, whilst they are viewed through a prism, some of them exhibit waves in one or two positions only; but the most of them do in all positions exhibit those waves, and that for the most part appearing almost all over the glass. The reason is, that the superficies of such plates are not even, but have many cavities and swellings, which, how shallow soever, do a little vary the thickness of the plate; and by the several sides of those cavities there must be produced waves in several postures of the prism. Now, though it be but some very small and narrow parts of the glass, by which these waves for the most part are caused, yet they may seem to extend themselves over the whole glass, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of several orders confusedly reflected, which by refraction of the prism are unfolded, and dispersed to several places, so as to constitute so many several waves as there were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the glass.
These are the principal phænomena of thin plates or bubbles, whose explications depend on the properties of light, that I have heretofore delivered: and these, you see, do necessarily follow from them, and agree with them even to their least circumstances; and not only so, but do very much tend to <294> their proof. Thus, by the twenty-fourth observation, it appears, that the rays of several colours, made, as well by thin plates or bubbles, as by the refractions of a prism, have several degrees of refrangibility, whereby those of each order, which, at their reflection from the plate or bubble, are intermixed with those of other orders, are separated from them by refraction, and associated together, so as to become visible by themselves, like arcs of circles. For, if the rays were all alike refrangible, it is impossible, that the whiteness, which to the naked sense appears uniform, should by refraction have its parts transposed, and ranged into those black and white arcs.
It appears also, that the unequal refractions of difform rays proceed not from any contingent irregularities, such as are veins, an uneven polish, or fortuitous position of the pores of glass, unequal motions in the air or æther, spreading, breaking, or dividing the same ray into many diverging parts, or the like. For, admitting any such irregularities, it would be impossible for refractions to render those rings so very distinct and well defined, as they do in the twenty-fourth observation. It is necessary therefore, that every ray have its proper and constant degree of refrangibility connate with it; according to which its refraction is ever justly and regularly performed, and that several rays have several of those degrees.
And what is said of their refrangibility may be understood of their reflexibility; that is, of their dispositions to be reflected, some at a greater, and others at a less thickness of thin plates or bubbles, namely, that those dispositions are also connate with the rays, and immutable, as may appear by the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth observations, compared with the fourth and eighteenth.
By the precedent observations it appears also, that the whiteness is a dissimilar mixture of all colours, and that light is a mixture of rays endowed with all those colours. For, considering the multitude of the rings of colours in the third, twelfth, and twenty-fourth observations, it is manifest, that, although in the fourth and eighteenth observations there appear more than eight or nine of those rings, yet there are really a far greater number, which so much interfere and mingle with one another, as, after those eight or nine revolutions, to dilute one another wholly, and constitute an even and sensible uniform whiteness. And consequently, that whiteness must be allowed a mixture of all colours, and the light, which conveys it to the eye, must be a mixture of rays endued with all those colours.
But further, by the twenty-fourth observation it appears, that there is a constant relation between colours and refrangibility, the most refrangible rays being violet, the least refrangible red, and those of intermediate colours having proportionally intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And, by the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth observations, compared with the fourth or eighteenth, there appears to be the same constant relation between colour and refrangibility; the violet being on equal terms reflected at least thickness of any thin <295> plate or bubble; the red at greatest thickness, and the intermediate colours at intermediate thicknesses: whence it follows, that the colorific dispositions of rays are also connate with them, and immutable; and by consequence, that all the productions and appearances of colours in the world are derived, not from any physical change caused in light by refraction of reflection, but ony from the various mixtures or separations of rays, by virtue of their different refrangibility. And, in this respect it is, that the science of colours becomes a speculation more proper for mathematicians than naturalists.
This being read, occasion was taken to discourse of Mr. NEWTON's theory itself, and to debate, whether the rays of light, which, though alike incident in the same medium, yet exhibit different colours, may not reasonably be said to owe that exhibition of different colours to the several degrees of the velocity of pulses, rather than, as Mr. NEWTON thought, to the several connate degrees of refrangibility in the rays themselves?
Mr. HOOKE was of opinion, that the former of these ways was sufficient to give a good account of the diversity of colours
February 10. Dr. MAPLETOFT was elected and admitted.
Capt. SHEERES, Mr. HALL, and Signor TRAVAGINO were elected.
Mr. BERCHENSHAW presented himself to the Society, and shewed them his scale of music, wherein were contained,
1. A table of all consonant and dissonant intervals suitable to musical harmony, which are practicable, and may be expressed by the voice and other instruments. To these respective intervals apt and proper numbers were assigned, by which their ratio's and proportions were demonstrated.
2. A system of all the keys, by which the aforesaid intervals were completed; of which keys some were natural; some intended to the first degree of acuteness; some remitted to the first degree of gravity; some twice spissated; some twice asperated.
3. In this scale the magnitude, dimension, and proportion of the said keys were exactly demonstrated according to the proportional parts of a chord, the chord being supposed thirty-six inches long.
If it were demanded, whether there was any thing in this table and system, that was not to be found in the scales and writings of other musicians? he answered,
1. That the intervals in this table were perfect and complete. There was not one too many, nor one wanting, which might conduce to the making of harmony.
<296>
2. That the sounds or musical numbers contained in this system arose out of the unison, and from one another, according to the reason of figurate, not simple numbers, (as, he said, he could demonstrate by numbers assigned to the respective intervals in the table) for that so the reason of the state of music required.
3. That there are neither more or less keys in this system, than would complete the aforesaid intervals.
4. That in this scale all the tones are of the same ratio, and that so are all the semitones, semiditones, ditones, and other intervals.
5. That the true magnitude and dimension of every one of the said keys are demonstrated according to the proportional parts of a chord.
6. That the natural, genuine, and true reason of the excellency and fullness of the harmony of three, four, frive, six, and seven parts, may clearly be discerned by the system of seven parts.
He added, that many other things were to be found in this table and scale, of which little or no mention is made in the scales and writings of either modern or antient musical authors; which, he said, he intended to discover, and to write of them at large, as he should be enabled thereunto.
He was exhorted to finish this work, or at least to publish this system with an explanation thereof.
After this was read the last part of Mr. NEWTON'S observations, wherein he considered in nine propositions, how the phænomena of thin transparent plates stand related to those of all other natural bodies: of which bodies having before mentioned, that they appear of divers colours, according as they are disposed to reflect most copiously the rays indued with these colours, he now inquires after their constitutions.
Here, among many other considerable things, he shews, how the bigness of the component parts of natural bodies may be conjectured by their colours: as also, that the cause of reflexion is not the impinging of light on the solid and impervious parts of bodies, as was commonly supposed.
This last part was as follows:
I am now come to the last part of this design; which is, to consider, how the phænomena of thin transparent plates stand related to those of all other natural bodies. Of these bodies I have already told you, that they appear of divers colours, according as they are disposed to reflect most copiously the rays endued with those colours. But their constitutions, whereby they reflect some rays <297> more copiously than others, remains to be inquired after. And this I shall endeavour in the following propositions.
Prop. 1. Those superficies reflect the greatest quantity of light, which have the greatest refracting power; that is, which interceeds mediums, that differ most in their refracting densities; and in the confines of equally dense mediums there is no reflection.
The analogy between reflection and refraction will appear by considering, that when light passeth obliquely out of one medium into another, which refracts from the perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their density, the less obliquity is requisite to cause a total reflection; because as the sines are, which measure the refraction, so is the sine of incidence, at which the total reflection begins, to the radius of the circle; and consequently that incidence is least, where there is the great difference of the sines. Thus in the passing of light out of water into air, where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines, 3 to 4, the total reflection begins, when the angle of the incidence is about forty- eight degrees and thirty-five minutes. In passing out of glass into air, where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31, the total reflection begins, when the angle of incidence is forty degress and ten minutes: and so, in passing out of crystal, or more strongly refracting mediums, into air, there is still a less obliquity requisite to cause a total reflection. Superficies therefore, which refract most, do soonest reflect all the light, which is incident on them, and so must be allowed most strongly reflective.
But the truth of this proposition will further appear, by observing, that in the superficies, interceeding any two of those mediums, air or water, or other liquors, common glass, crystal, and metalline glasses, the reflection is stronger or weaker accordingly as the superficies hath a greater or less refracting power. Thus, when other mediums are contiguous to air, the reflection is stronger in the superficies of glass than of water, still stronger in the superficies of crystal, and strongest in the superficies of metalline glass. So, in the confine of water and common glass, the reflection is very weak, but yet stronger than in the confine of water and oil, or almost any two liquors, and still stronger in the confine of water and crystal, or metalline glass: accordingly as those mediums differ more or less in density, so in the confine of common glass and crystal there is a weak reflection, and a stronger relection in the confine of common and metalline glass: but in the confine of two glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible reflection, as was shewn in the first observation. And the same may be understood of the superficies of two crystals or liquors, or any other substances, in which no refraction is caused: whence it comes to pass, that uniform mediums have no sensible reflexion but in their external superficies, where they are adjacent to their mediums of a different density.
Prop. 2. The least parts of natural bodies are in some measure transparent; and the opacities of those bodies arise from the multitude of reflections caused in their internal parts.
<298>
That this is so, will easily be granted by them, that have been conversant with microscopes: and it may also be tried by applying any substance to a hole, through which the light is emitted into a dark room; for how opake soever that substance may seem in the open air, it will, by that means, appear very manifestly transparent, if it be of a sufficient thickness: only metalline bodies must be exempted, which, by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the light incident on their first superficies.
Prop. 3. Between the parts of opake or coloured bodies are many interstices, replenished with mediums of other densities, as water between the tinging corpuscles, wherewith any liquor is impregnated; air between the aqueous globules that constitute clouds or mists; and for the most part spaces void of both air and water; but yet perhaps replenished with some subtiler medium between the parts of hard bodies.
The truth of this is evinced by the two precedent propositions: for by the second proposition there are many reflections from the internal part of bodies, which by the first proposition would not happen, if the parts of those bodies were continued without any such interstices between them, because reflections are caused only in superficies, which interceed mediums of a different density.
But further, that this discontinuity of parts is the principal cause of the opacity of bodies, will appear by considering, that opake substances become transparent by filling their pores with any substance of equal, or almost equal density with their parts. Thus paper dipped in water or oil, the oculus mundi stone steeped in water, linen-cloth oiled or varnished, and many other substances soaked in such liquors, as will intimately pervade their little pores, become by that means more transparent than otherwise. So, on the contrary, the most transparent substances may, by separating their parts, be rendered sufficiently opake; as glass, by being reduced to powder, or otherwise flawed, water by being formed into many small bubbles, either alone in the form of froth, or by shaking it together with oil of turpentine, or some other convenient liquor, with which it will not incorporate, and horn by being scraped.
To the increase of the opacity of these bodies it conduces something, that by the twenty third observation, the refractions of very thin transparent substances are considerably stronger than those made by the same substances of a greater thickness. And to the reflection of solid bodies it may be further added, that the interstices of their parts are void of air. For that for the most part they are so, it is reasonable to believe, considering the ineptitude, which air hath to pervade small cavities, as appears by the ascension of water in slender glass-pipes, paper, cloth, and other such like substances, whose pores are found too small to be replenished with air, and yet large enough to admit water; and by the difficulty, wherewith air pervades the pores of a bladder, through which water find ready passage. And according to the eleventh observation, the cavities thus void of air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflection, which those do, that are replenished with it; but yet something more manifestly, be <299> cause the medium in relation to refractions is rarest, when most empty of air as Mr. HOOKE hath proved in his Micrographia; in which book he hath also largely discoursed of this and the precedent proposition, and delivered many other very excellent things concerning the colours of thin plates, and other natural bodies, which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for my purpose.
Prop. 4. The parts of bodies and their interstices must not be less than of some definitive bigness, to render them opake and coloured; for the opakest bodies, if their parts be subtilly divided (as metals by being dissolved in acid menstruums, &c.) become prefectly transparent. And you may also remember, that in the eighth observation there was no reflection at the superficies of the object-glasses, where they were very near one another, though they did not absolutely touch. And in the seventeenth observation, the reflection of the water-bubble, where it became thinnest, was almost insensible, so as to cause the apparitions of very black spots.
On these grounds I conceive it is, that water, salt, glass, stones, and such like substances, are transparent; for, upon divers considerations, they seem to be as porous as other bodies, but yet their pores and parts too small to cause any opacity.
Prop. 5. The transparent parts of bodies, according to their several sizes, must reflect rays of one colour, and transmit those of another, on the same grounds, that thin plates or bubbles do reflect or transmit those rays: and this I take to be the ground of all their colours.
For, if a thinned or plated body, which being of an even thickness appears all over of one uniform colour, should be broken into fragments of the same thickness with the plate, I see no reason, why a heap of those fragments should not constitute a powder of the same colour, which the plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all natural bodies, being like so many fragments of a plate, must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours.
Now, that they do so, will further appear by the affinity of their properties: as that the infusion of nephritic-wood, and many other substances reflect one colour, and transmit another, like thin bodies in the ninth and twentieth observations. That the colours of silks, cloaths, and other substances, which water or oil can intimately penetrate, become more faint and obscure by being emerged in those liquors, and recover their vigour again by being dried, much after the manner declared of thin bodies, in the tenth and twenty first observations: and that some of those coloured powders, which painters use, may have their colours a little changed, by being very elaborately and finely ground. Where I see not, what can be justly pretended for those changes, besides the breaking of their parts into less parts by that contrition, after the same manner that the colour of a plate is changed by varying its thickness. For which reason also it is, that many flowers, by being bruised, become more transparent <300> than before, or, at least in some degree or other, change their colours. Nor is it much less to my purpose, that, by mixing divers liquors, very odd and remarkable productions and changes of colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious and natural, than that the saline corpuscles of one liquor do variously act upon, or unite with, the tinging corpuscles of another; so as to make them swell or shrink (whereby not only their bulk, but their density also may be changed) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, or make many of them associate into one cluster; for we see how apt those saline menstruums are to penetrate and dissolve substances, to which they are applied; and some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner, if we consider the various phænomena of the atmosphere, we may observe, that when vapours are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflection in their superficies: but when, in order to compose drops of rain, they began to coalesce and constitute globules of all intermediate sizes, those globules, when they become of a convenient size to reflect some colours, and transmit others, may constitute clouds of various colours, according to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally conceived, in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these colours, besides the various sizes of its parcels, which seem to affect a globular figure most; but yet perhaps not without some instability in the smallest of them, by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any trembling motions in the air.
Prop. 6. The parts of bodies, on which their colours depend, are denser than the medium, which pervades their interstices.
This will appear by considering, that the colour of a body depends not only on the rays, which are incident perpendicularly or its parts, but on those also, which are incident at all other angles. And that, according to the seventh observation, a very little variation of obliquity will change the reflected colour, where the thin body or small particle is rarer than the ambient medium, in somuch that such a small particle will, at diversly oblique incidents, reflect all sorts of colours, in so great a variety, that the colour, resulting from them all confusedly reflected from a heap of such particles, must rather be a white or grey, than any other colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect and dirty colour; whereas, if the thin body or small particle be much denser than the ambient medium, the colours, according to the nineteenth observation, are so little changed by the variation of obliquity, that the rays, which are reflected least obliquely, may predominate over the rest so much, as to cause a heap of such particles to appear very intensly of their colour.
It concludes also something to this proposition, that, according to the twenty-second observation, the colours exhibited by the denser thin body within the rarer are more brisk than those exhibited by the rarer within the denser.
Prop. 7. The bigness of the component parts of natural bodies may be conjectured by their colours.
<301>
For since the parts of these bodies, by proposition 5. do most probably exhibit the same colours with a plate of equal thickness, provided they have the same refractive density; and since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with water or glass, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect: to determine the sizes of these parts, you need only have recourse to the precedent tables, in which the thickness of water or glass exhibiting any colour is expressed. Thus, if it be desired to know the diameter of a corpuscle, which being of equal density with glass, shall reflect green of the third order; the number 17 shows it to be about  parts of an inch.
The greatest difficulty is here to know, of what order the colour of any body is; and for this end we muct have recourse to the fourth and eighteenth observations, from whence may be collected these particulars.
Scarlets, and other reds, oranges and yellows, if they be pure and intense, are most probably of the second order. Those of the first and third order also may be pretty good; only the orange and red of the third order have too great a mixture of violet and blue.
There may be good greens of the fourth order, but the purest are of the third: and of this order the green of all vegetables seems to be, partly by reason of the intenseness of their colours, and partly because when they wither, some of them turn to a greenish yellow, and others to a more perfect yellow or orange, or perhaps to red; passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate colours, which changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture, which may leave the tinging corpuscles more dense, and something augmented by the accretion of the oily and earthy part of that moisture. Now the green, without doubt, is of the same order with those colours, into which it changeth, because the changes are gradual, and those colours, though usually not very pure, yet for the most part are too pure and lively to be of the fourth order.
Blues and purples may be either of the second or third order; but the best are of the third. Thus the colour of violet seems to be of that order; because their syrup, by acid liquors, turns red, and by urinous and alkalazite turns green. For since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or attenuate, and of alcalis to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the syrup was of the second order, an acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would tinge it to a red of the first order, and an alcali, by incrassating them, would change it to a green of the second order; which red and green, especially the green, seem too imperfect to be the colours produced by these changes. But if the said purple be supposed of the third order, its change to red of the second and green of the third may, without any inconvenience, be allowed.
If there be found any body of a deeper and less reddish purple than that of violets, its colour most probably is of the second order. But yet there being no body commonly known, whose colour is constantly more deep than theirs, <302> I have made use of their name to denote the deepest and least reddish purples, such as manifestly transcend their colour in purity.
The blue of the first order, though very faint and little, may possibly be the colour of some substances; and particularly the azure colour of the skies seems to be of this order. For all vapours, when they begin to condense and coalesce into small parcels, become first of that bigness, whereby such an azure must be reflected, before they can constitute clouds of other colours. And so this being the first colour, which vapours begin to reflect, it ought to be the colour of the finest and most transparent skies, in which vapours are not arrived to that grossness requisite to reflect other colours, as we find it is by experience.
Whiteness, if it be intense, is either that in the first order of colours, of which sort perhaps is the colour of white lead; or else it is a mixture of those succeeding the third or fourth order, such as is the colour of paper, linen, and most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes, exhibiting the colours of the second and third order, be mixed, they should rather constitute an imperfect whiteness or grey, of which I have already spoken: but yet it seems not impossible for them to exhibit an intense whiteness, if they be disposed to transmit all the light, which they reflect not, and do not retain and stifle much of it. For thus I told you, that froth at a distance hath appeared very white, and yet, near at hand, the several bubbles, of which it was constituted, were seen tinged all over with rings of colours of the four or five first orders.
Lastly, for the production of black, the corpuscles must be less than any of those, which exhibit colours. For at all greater sizes there is too much light reflected to constitute this colour. But if they be supposed a little less than is requisite to reflect the blue of the first order, they will, according to the fourth, eighth, seventeenth, and eighteenth observations, reflect so very little light as to appear intensely black, and yet may perhaps variously refract it to and fro within themselves so long, until it happen to be stifled and lost; by which means they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transparency. And from hence may be understood, why fire, and the more subtil dissolver, putrefaction, turn substances to black; why small quantities of black substances impart their colour very freely and intensely to other substances, to which they are applied; why glass ground very elaborately, on a copper-plate, till it be well polished, makes the sand, together with what is worn off from the glass, and copper, become very black; why black substances do soonest of all others become hot and burn, which effect may proceed, partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, and partly from the easy commotion of so very small corpuscles; and why blacks are usually a little inclined to a bluish colour. For that they are so, may be seen by illuminating white paper by reflection from black substances, which will usually appear of a bluish white. And the reason is, that black borders on the obscure blue of the first order, described in the eighteenth observation, whence the corpuscles of black substances are most apt to reflect that colour.
<303>
In these descriptions I have been the more particular, because it is not impossible, but that microscopes may at length be improved to the discovery of corpuscles of bodies, on which their colours depend. For if those instruments could be so far improved, as with sufficient distinctness to represent objects five or six hundred times bigger than at a foot distance they appear to our naked eyes. I should hope, that we might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles. And by one, that would magnify three or four thousand times, perhaps they might all be discovered but those, which produce blackness. In the mean while, I see nothing material, that rationally can be doubted of, excepting this position, that transparent corpuscles of the same thickness and density with a plate do exhibit the same colour. And this I would have understood not without some latitude, as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular figures, and many rays must be obliquely incident, and so have a shorter way through them than the length of their diameter; as because the straitness of the medium, pent in on all sides, may a little alter its motions, or other qualities, on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last, because I have observed of some small plates of Muscovy-glass, which were of an even thickness, that through a microscope they have appeared of the same colour at their edges and corners, where the included medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However, it would add much to our satisfaction, if those corpuscles could be discovered with microscopes, which if we shall ever attain to, I fear it will be the utmost improvement of this sense; for it seems impossible to see the more secret and noble works of nature within those corpuscles, by reason of their transparency.
This may suffice concerning the constitution of natural bodies, on which their colours depend. But for further understanding the nature of reflections, I shall add these two following propositions.
Prop. 8. The cause of the reflection is not the impinging of light on the solid and impervious parts of bodies, as is commonly supposed.
This will appear by the following considerations: first, that in the passage of light out of glass into air, there is a reflection as strong or stronger than in its passage out of air into glass, and by many degrees stronger than in its passage out of glass into water. And it seems not probable, that air should have more reflecting parts than water or glass. But if that should possibly be supposed, it will avail nothing; for the reflection is as strong, if not stronger, when the air is drawn away from the glass (suppose in the air-pump invented by Mr. BOYLE) as when it is adjacent to it. Secondly, if light in its passage out of glass into air be incident more obliquely than at an angle of forty or forty-one degrees, it is wholly reflected; if less obliquely, it is in great measure transmitted. Now it is not to be imagined, that light at one degree of obliquity should meet with pores enough in the air to transmit the greater part of it, and at another degree of obliquity meet with nothing but parts to reflect it wholly; especially considering, that in its passage out of air into glass, how oblique soever be its incidence, it finds pores enough in the glass to transmit the greatest part of it. <304> If any man suppose, that it is not reflected by the air, but by the utmost superficial parts of the glass, there is still the same difficulty; besides, that such a supposition is unintelligible; and will also appear to be false, by applying water behind some part of the glass instead of air. For so in a convenient obliquity of the rays, suppose of forty-five or forty-six degrees, at which they are all reflected, where the air is adjacent to the glass, they shall be in great measure transmitted, where the water is adjacent to it; which argues, that their reflection or transmission depends on the consitution of the air and water behind the glass, and not on the parts of the glass.
Thirdly, if the colours made by a prism, placed at the entrance of a beam of light into a darkened room, be successively cast on a second prism placed at a great distance from the former, in such manner that they are all alike incident upon it; the second prism may be so inclined to the incident rays, that those, which are of a blue colour, shall be all reflected by it; and yet those of a red colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if the reflection be caused by the parts of air or glass, I would ask, why at the same obliquity of incidence the blue should wholly impinge on those parts so as to be all reflected, and yet the red find pores enough to be in great measure transmitted. Fourthly, where two glasses touch one another, there is no sensible reflection, as was declared in the first observation; and yet I see no reason, why the rays should not impinge on the parts of glass, when contiguous to another glass, as much as when contiguous to air. Fifthly, when the top of a water-bubble (in the seventeenth observation) by the continual subsiding and exhaling of the water grew very thin, there was such a little and almost insensible quantity of light reflected from it, that it appeared intensely black; whereas, round about that black spot, where the water was thicker, the reflection was so strong as to make the water seem very white. Nor is it only at the least thickness of thin plates or bubbles that there is no manifest reflection, but at many other thicknesses continually greater and greater. For in the fifteenth observation, the rays of the same colour were by turns transmitted at one thickness, and reflected at another thickness, for an intermediate number of successions. And yet in the superficies of the third body, where it is of any one thickness, there are as many parts for the rays to impinge on, as where it is of any other thickness.
Lastly, if reflection were caused by the parts of reflecting bodies, it would be impossible for thin plates or bubbles, at the same place to reflect the rays of one colour, and transmit those of another, as they do according to the thirteenth and fifteenth observations. For it is not to be imagined, that at one place the rays, which, for instance, exhibit a blue colour, should have the fortune to dash upon the parts, and those, which exhibit a red, to hit upon the pores of the body; and then at another place, where the body is either a little thicker, or a little thinner, that on the contrary the blue should hit upon its pores, and the red upon its parts.
Prop. 9. It is most probable, that the rays, which impinge on the solid parts of any body, are not reflected but stifled and lost in that body.
<305>
This is consentaneous to the precedent proposition, and will further appear by considering, that if all the rays should be reflected, which impinge on the internal parts of clear water or crystal, those substances should rather have a cloudy than so very clear transparency.
And further, there would be no principle of the obscurity or blackness, which some bodies have in all positions of the eye. For to produce this effect, it is necessary, that many rays be retained and lost in the body, and it seems not probable, that any rays can be stopped and retained in it, which do not impinge on its parts.

Draft of the 'Hypothesis Concerning Light and Colors'
Sir
I have sent you the papers I mentioned, by Iohn Stiles. Vpon reviewing them I find some things so obscure as to need a further explication by figures, & some other things I guess will not be new to to you though almost all was new to me when I wrote them: but {as} they are I hope you will accept of them though not worth the ample thanks you sent. I remember in some discourse with Mr Hook I happend to say that I thought light was reflected not by the parts of glass water air or other sensible bodies, but by that same superficies of the æthereal Mediums which refracts it , the rays finding some difficulty to break through it in passing out of denser æther into rarer & a greater difficulty in passing out of the rarer into the denser, & so being either reflected or refracted by the superficies as the circumstances they happen to be in at their incidence make 'em unable or able to break through it. And for confirmation of this I said further that I thought the reflexion of the light at its tending out of glass into air would not be diminisht or weakend by drawing away the air in an air Pump as it ought to be if they were the parts of the air that reflected it: And added that I had not tryed this experiment; but thought he was not unacquainted with notions of this kind. To which he replied that the notion was new & that he would the first opportunity try the experiment I propounded. But upon reviewing the papers I send you, I found it there set down for tryed; which makes me recollect that some years ago I had occasionally observed in an Air Pump here at Christs College that I could not perceive the reflexion of the inside of the glass diminished by drawing out the air. This I thought fit to mention least my former forgetfulness should make me seem to have set down for certain what I never tryed.
Sir I had formerly purposed never to write any Hypothesis of light & colours, fearing it might be a means to ingage me in vain disputes: but I hope I need not fear that if it proceed no further then to the ears of the Society. Considering therefore that such an Hypothesis will much illustrate the papers I send you; I shall not scruple to describe one so far as it may be done in this cursory letter: not concerning my self whether it shall be thought probable or improbable so it do but render the papers I send you more intellegible
<475v>
First then in this Hypothesis it is to be supposed that there is an æthereal Medium much of the same constitution with air but only far more rare more subtile & more strongly elastic: And of the existence of this Medium the motion of a pendulum in a glass exhasted of air almost as quickly as in the open air is no inconsiderable argument.
.2. I suppose this æther a vibrating Medium like air, only the vibrations far more swift & minute; those of air made by a man's ordinary voice succeeding one another at more then a foot distance, but those of æther at a less distance then the hundred thousandth part of an inch. And as in air the vibrations are some larger then others, but yet all equally swift (for in a ring of bells the sound of every tone is heard at 3 or 4 miles distance, in the same order that the bells are stroke:) so I suppose the æthereal vibrations differ in bignes but not in swiftness.
3 As the air can pervade the bores of small glass pipes but yet not so easily as if they were wider, & therefore stands at greater degree of rarity then in the free aereal spaces, & at so much a greater degree of rarity as the pipe is smaller, as is known by the rising of water in such pipesto a much greater height then the surface of the stagnating water into which they are dipt: so I suppose æther, though it pervades the pores of crystal, glass, water & other natural bodies, yet it stands at a greater degree of rarity in those pores then in the free æthereal spaces & at so much a greater degree of rarity as the pores of the body are smaller. Whence it may be that  for instance though a lighter body yet having subtiler parts & consequently smaller pores then water is the more strongly refracting liquor. This also may be the principall cause of the cohesion of the parts of solids & fluids, & of the standing of the  in the Torricellian experiment at a much greater height then 29 inches: For the denser æther which surrounds these bodies must croud & press their parts together much after the same manner that the air surrounding two marbles presses them together if there be little or no air between them.
4 I suppose light is neither this æther not its vibrating motion, but something of a different kind propagated from lucid bodies, whether it be an aggregate of peripatetic qualities or of unimaginably small & swift corpuscles from luminous bodies at great distances from one another or any other corporeal emanation, or some motion of the æther of a differing kind from its vibrations if any such can be imagind proper for this purpose, or an impuls or motion of some other medium dispersed through the æther For the air, vapors – , exhalations electric & magnetic effluvia are all instances that there may be a corporeal emanation or an impuls or motion of some other medium dispersed through æther like the magnetic or electric effluvia, or some motion of the æther of a differing kind from its vibrations if any such can be imagin'd proper for this purpose, or a peripatetic quality. To avoyd dispute & make this Hypothesis general let every man here take his fancy. Only whatever light be I would suppose it consists of successive rays differing from one another in contingent circumstances, as bignes form or vigour; like as the sands on the shore the waves of the sea the faces of men & all other natural things of the same kind differ, it being almost impossible for any sort of things to be found without some contingent variety. And further I would suppose it divers from the æthereal vibrations becaus
[5 As there is a certain tenacity in the superficies of water more then in the inwards parts of either water or air so that dust or even the filings of a metal which readily fall in either water or air will swim if thrown upon their common superficies: so I suppose there is a greater tenacity in the common superficies of a rarer & denser æther then in other places, so that the rays of light find some difficulty in passing through that superficies & are refracted or reflected accordingly as they can or cannot overcome the difficulty. Yet this superficies I suppose to be not a mathematical one like that of water, but of some breadth, the æther therein being of all intermediate degrees of rarity between the rarer & denser Mediums.
6 When the rays impinge upon this superficies I suppose they cause vibrations in it as stones thrown into water do in its surface, & that these vibrations are propagated every way into both the rarer & denser Mediums as the vibrations of air which cause sound, are from a stroke but yet continue strongest where they began, & alternately contract & dilate the æther in that physical superficies:  which superficies being thus continually agitated by vibration & the æther therein continually expanded & comprest by turns; if a ray of <476r> light impinge upon it while it is much comprest, I suppose it is then too dense & stiffe to let the ray pass through & so it reflects it, but the rays that impinge on it at other times, go through & are refracted.
To explain this a little further you may consider how fluids when formed into thin shells or plates grow much more tenacious & tough then otherwise. Thus things which readily fall in water if let fall upon a bubble of water they do not easily break through it but are apt to slide down by the sides of it if they be not too bigg & heavy. So if two well polished convex glasses grownd on very large spheres be laid one upon another, the air between them easily recedes till they almost touch but then begins to resist so much that the weight of the upper glasse is too little to bring together so as to make the black spot mentioned in these papers appeare in the midst of the rings of colours; & if the glasses be plain though no broader then a two pence, a man with his whole strength is not able to press all the air out from between them so as to make 'em fully touch. You may observe also that Insects will walk upon water without wetting their feet, the thin skin or shell between their feet & the water bearing them up & so motes falling upon water will often lye long upon it without being wetted. And in like manner I suppose a ray in passing out of denser æther into rarer, when there remains between the ray of the rarer æther so little distance to be part through that the denser æther between them may be compared to a thin skin or shell, it finds some difficulty to get through this skin: & the æther where this skin is being alternately expanded & comprest by the vibrations wherewith 'tis continually agitated, the skin is sometimes weakned by the expansion sometimes strengthend & stifned by the compression & accordingly transmits or reflects the ray.
When a ray finds the refracting superficies so much condensed that it cannot get through, so soon as the ray has spent its force upon the superficies in endeavouring to pierce it, the superficies by its elasticity returns back upon the ray as a racket upon a tennis ball, all the force it received & so reflects it at an angle equal to that of incidence. But if the superficies at the arrival of the ray be in a state of expansion, or not so much condensed but that the ray can pierce it, then I suppose upon the rays departing into the next Medium the superficies acts upon it & adds more or less celerity to it according to the rarity of that Medium; for the rarer the medium is which the ray enters, the more easily does the ray yeild to the action of the superficies. To use a gross similitude you may conceive the action of the superficies upon the departing ray, to be something like that of a man's fingers darting a plumb-stone or other slippery body from between them by compressing it; for ] When a ray therefore moves through æther of uneaven density, I suppose it is most prest, urged or otherwise acted upon by the æther on that side towards the denser æther & receives a continual impulsor ply from that side to recede towards the rarer, & so is accelerated if it move that way or retarded if the contrary. On this ground if a ray move obliquely through such an uneavenly dense medium (that is obliquely to those imaginary superficies which run through the equally dens parts of ye medium & may be called the refracting superficies,) it must be incurved, as it is found to be by observation in water when lower parts were gradually made more salt & so more dense then the upper [1]. And this may be the ground of all refraction & reflexion: for as the rarer air with a small glas pipe & the denser air without are not disterminated by a mathematical superficies but the air between at the orifice of the pipe runs through all intermediate degrees of density so I suppose the refracting superficies of æther between unequally dense Mediums to be not a mathematical one but of some breadth the æther therein being of all intermediate degrees of rarity between the rarer & denser æthereal mediums, & refraction I conceive to proceed from the continual incurvation of the ray all the while it is passing this physical superficies. Now if the motion of the ray be supposed in this passage to be incurved or diminished in a certain proportion according to the difference of the densities of the æthereal mediums, & the addition or detraction of the motion be reccond in the perpendicular from the refracting superficies, the sines <476v> of incidence & refraction will be proportional according to what Cartes has demonstrated.
The ray therefore in passing out of the rarer medium into the denser inclines continually more & more towards the refracting superficies & if the differing densities of the mediums be not so great nor the incidence of the ray so obliq3 as to make it  to that superficies before it gets through, then it goes through & & is refracted, but if through the aforesaid causes the ray become  to that superficies before it can get through, then it must turn back & be reflected. Thus for instance it may be observed in triangular glas prism OEF that ye rays AN that tend out of the refr. sup glass into air, do by inclining yn more & more to them, emerge more & more obliquely as at NL till they be infinitely oblique that is in a manner  to the refracting superficies which happens when the angle of incidence is about 60 or 61 gr. & then if they be a little more inclined they become all reflected, as at Aνλ becoming I suppose  to the superficies before they can get thrugh it. let ABCD represent the rarer Medium, EFHG the denser  CDFE the space between them or refracting physicall superficies in which the æther is of all intermediate degrees of density from the rarest æther at CD to the densest at EF. AL a ray, AN its incident part MN its incurvation by the refracting superficies, & NL its emergent part. Now if the ray AM be so much incurved as to become at its emergence N, as nearely as may be  to CD , its plain that if that ray had been incident a little more obliquely it must have become parallel to CD before it had arrived at EF & so could never have got to the outside of the refracting superficies EF but must have turnd back & been reflected as it is represented at Aμνλ. And the like would have happend if the density of the æther had further increased from EF to PQ so that PQHG might be a denser medium then EFHG was supposed, for then the ray in passing from m to n being so much incurved as at n to become  to CD or PQ, its impossible it should ever get nearer to PQ but must at N begin by further incurvation to turn back & so be reflected. *○
This may be the cause & manner of relexion when light tend from the rarer toward the denser æther, but to know how it should be reflected when it tends from the denser into the rarer you are to consider how fluids neare their superficies are less pliant & yeilding then in their more inward parts, & if formed into a thin plate or shel they become much more stif & tenacious then otherwise. Thus things let fall –––– And so I suppose æther in the confine of two mediums is less pliant & yeilding then in other places & so much the less pliant by how much the mediums differ more in density: so that a ray in passing through this {cuticle} & so great difficulty where the mediums are of very differing density as to be reflected by incurvation after the manner described above: the parts of the æther on that side where they are less pliant & yeilding acting upon the ray much after the manner that thay would do were they denser there then on the other side And this I suppose {may} be the cause of the reflexion of Quicksilver & other metalline bodies. It must concur to increase the reflective virtue of the superficies when rays tend out of the rarer into the denser. And in that case therefore the reflexion having a double cause <477r> much; after the same manner as if all the glass between B & D were broken off at B the obtuse angle of the Diamond cut.

Obs. 1. And hence I seem to gather that the rays in passing by the sides of the hair at a little distance are bent & those are most bent which pass by the hair at the leats distance. Let H represent the  hair, aei, bfk, cgl, dhm four rays passing by the hair at several distances & bent in e, f, g, h & let them fall on the paper beyond the hair at i, k, l, m. And let nrw, osx, pty, qvz represent four other rays passing by the hair on the other side & bent in r, s, t, v & let them fall on the paper at w, x, y, z. And let mz be the shadow of the hair cast upon the paper. By this bending of the rays the shadow will become broader then it would be if they were not bent, [&] Produce the outmost rays dh & qu in right lines to A & B & if those rays were not bent in passing by the hair the breadth of the shadow of the hair upon the paper would not be greater then AB whereas by experrience its found considerably greater.] And if the rays which pass by the hair at the least distance be most bent as is represented in the figure the shadow will be broadest in proportion to the distance of the paper from the hair when the paper is nearest to the hair, as is found true by experience. But if the outmost rays dh & qu be not bent, produce them in right lines & let them fall on the paper at A, B & the breadth of the shadow will be AB which is less then it is found by experience these rays are therefore bent tho not so much <477v> as the rays which pass by the hair at a less distance.
So then the dark lines above mentioned which run along between the first and second fringes of the shadows of either knife & meet in the middle of the light which passes between the knives at the distance of a fift part of an inch from the concourse of the edges of the knives, are in the passage of the light between the knives distant from the edges of the knives the 320th part of an inch or there abouts.
At another time when the two knives were distant eight feet & five inches from the little hole in the window made with a small pin as above, the point i where the dark line {illeg}is & xip meet & cross one another between the first fringes of the shadows of the two knives, fell upon a paper placed at the following distances from the knives when the distances between the edges of the knives were also as follows.

And hence I gather that the light which makes the fringes with the shadows between them upon the paper is not the same light at all distances of the paper from the knives, but when the paper is held neare the knives the fringes are made by light which passes by the edges of the knives at a less distance & is more bent then when the paper is held at a greater distance.
When I made these Observations I designed to repeat most of them with more care & exactness & to make some new ones for determining the manner how the rays of light are bent in their passage by bodies for making these fringes of colours with the dark lines between them: but I was then interrupted & cannot now think of taking these things into further consideration. And since I have not finished this part of my designe I shall conclude with proposing some Quæres in order to a further search to be made by others. [who may take these things into consideration]
Quære 1. Do not Bodies act upon light at a distance & by their action bend its rays & is not this action strongest at the least distance.
 1B. Are not &c < insertion from f 478r >  1B. Are not the rays of light in passing by the edges & sides of bodies bent several times backwards & forwards with a motion like that of an Eele.

2 Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility differ also in flexibility& are they not by their different inflexions separated from one another so as after separation to make the colours in the three fringes above described. And after what manner are they inflected to make those fringes.
3 Do not the rays of light which fall upon bodies & are reflected or refracted begin to bend before they arive at the bodies, & are they not reflected refracted & inflected by one & the same Principle acting variously in various circumstances.
4 Do not light & bodies act mutually upon one another, that is to say bodies upon light in emitting reflecting refracting & inflecting it, & light make <478r> ally upon bodies for heating them & pulling their parts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists. And do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those ‡ < insertion from lower down f 478r > ‡ {Ad} 4. {Ad} Do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those of other colours do by reason that the light falling on them is not reflected back but enters the bodies & is often reflected & refracted within them before it is shifted & lost. And is not the greatness or vigour of the action between light & sulphureous bodies observed above one reason why sulphureous bodies take fire more readily & burn more vehemently then other bodies do?
< text from f 478r resumes >
5 Do not all fixt bodies when heated beyond a certain degree emit light by the vibrating motion of their parts.
6 Is not fire a body heated so hot as to emit light copiously. For what else is a red hot iron or a red hot stone then fire & what else is a burning coale then red hot wood [whose heat is preserved by the actions of an acid spirit in the air acting upon & dissolving the wood.
7 Is not the flame a vapour fume or exhalation heated red hot that is so hot as to shine For bodies do not flame which do not emit a copious fume.
8 Are not the sun & fixt stars great earths vehemently hot whose heat is conserved by the mutual action & reaction between them & the light which they emit & whose parts are kept from fuming away by the vast weight of the Atmospheres incumbent upon them.
9 Do not the rays of light in falling upon the bottom of the eye, excite vibrations in the Tunica retina which vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the Optick Nerves into the brain cause the sense of seeing. * < insertion from lower down f 478r > * For since dense bodies conserve their heat a long time & the densest bodies conserve their heat the longest, the vibrations of their parts are of a lasting nature & therefore may be propagated along solid fibres of uniform dense matter to a great distance for conveying into the brain the impressions made upon all the Organs of sense. For that motion which can continue long in {illeg} & the same part of a body can be propagated a long way from one part to another supposing the body homogeneal so that the motion may not be reflected refracted & interrupted or disordered by any uneavenness of the body. < text from f 478r resumes > 10 Do not several sorts of rays make vibrations of several bignesses, which according to their bignesses excite sensations of several colours much after the manner that the vibrations of the air according to their several bignesses exite sensation of several sounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible the largest for making a sensation of deep red & the several intermediate sorts of rays vibrations of several intermediate bignesses to make sensations of the several intermediate colours?
11 May not the harmony & discord of colours arise from the proportions of the vibrations propagated through the optic nerves into the brain as the harmony & discord of sounds arises from the proportions of the vibrations of the air. For some colours are agreable as those of gold & Indigo & others disagree.
12 Are not the species of objects seen with both eyes united when the Optick nerves meet before they come into the brain: the fibres on the right side of both Nerves uniting there & after unison going thence into the brain in the nerve which is on the right side of the head & the fibres on the left side of both nerves uniting in the same place & after union going into the brain in the nerve which is on the left side of the head & these two nerves meeting in the brain in such a manner thet their fibres make but one intire species half of which on the right side of the sensorium comes from the right side of both eyes & the other half of which on the left side of the sensorium comes from the left side of both eyes? For the optic nerves of such animals as look the same way with both eyes (as of Men, Doggs, Sheep, Oxen) meet before they go into the brain, but the Optic nerves of such animals as do not look the same way with both eyes (as of Fishes & the Chameleon) do not meet if I am rightly informed.

 Obs.1.  Let X represent one end of the Hair, adg, beh, cfi three rays passing by one side of the hair at several distances, kng, lor, mps three other rays passing by the other side of the hair at the like distances; d, e, f & n, o, p the places where these">the rays are bent in their passage by the hair; g, h, i, q, r, s the places where these rays fall on paper si the breadth of the shadow of the hair cast on the paper & Ai & Bs two rays passing to the points i & s without bending when the hair is taken away. And it is manifest that all the light between the lines Ai & Bs is bent in passing by the hair & turned aside from the shadow: for if any part of this light were not bent it would fall on the paper within the shadow si & there illuminate it contrary to experience. Bodies therefore act upon the light at a considerable distance in its passing by them; but the action is strongest on the rays which pass by at the least distances & grows weaker & weaker accordingly as the rays pass by them at distances greater & greater, as is represented in the scheme For thence it comes to pass that the shadow of the hair is much broader in proportion to the distance of the paper from the hair when the paper is neare the hair then when it is at a great distance from it. 
Ad Obs. 6. And hence the light which is least bent & goes to the inward ends of the streams passes by the edges of the knives at the greatest distance, & this distance when the shadow begins to appear between the streams is about the eight hundredth part of an inch. And the light which passes by the edges of the knives at distances still less & less is more & more bent & goes to those parts of the streams which are further & further from the direct light, [because as the knives approach one another till they touch, the light at the inward ends of the streams vanishes more and more & the streams grow shorter & shorter at those ends untill they wholy disappear.]
Ad Obs. 7. And hence the light of the first fringe passed by the edge of the knife at a distance greater then the eight hundreth part of an inch & the light of the second fringe passed by the edge of the knife at a greater distance then the light of the first fringe did, & that of the third at a greater distance <479r> Could all the phænomena of nature be [evidently] deduced from only thre or four general suppositions there might be great reason to allow those suppositions to be true: but if for explaining every new Phænomena you make a new Hypothesis if you suppose that the particles of Air are of such a figure size & frame, those of water of such another those of Vinegre of such another , those of sea salt of such another , those of nitre of such another, those of Vitriol of such another, those of Quicksilver of such another, those of flame of such another, those of Magnetick effluvia of such another, If you suppose that light consists in such a motion pression or force, & that its various colours are made by such & such variations of the motion & so of other things: your Philosophy will be nothing else then a systeme of Hypotheses. And what certainty can there be in a Philosophy which consists in as many Hypotheses as there are Phæ nomena to be explained. To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. Tis much better to do a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come after, then to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing. And there is no other way of doing any thing with certainty then by drawing conclusions from experiments & phænomena untill you come at general Principles & then from those Principles giving an account of Nature. Whatever is certain in Philosophy is owing to this method & nothing can be done without it. I will instance in some particulars.
One principle in Philosophy is the being of a God or spirit infinite eternal omniscient, omnipotent, & the best argument for such a being is the frame of nature & chiefly the contrivance of the bodies of living creatures. All the great land animals have two eyes, in the forehead a nose between them a mouth under the nose, two ears on the sides of the head, two arms or two fore leggs or two wings on the sholders & two leggs behind & this symmetry in the several species could not proceed from chance there being an equal chance for one eye or for three or four eyes as for two, & so of the other members Nothing is more curious & difficult then the frame of the eyes for seeing & of the ears for hearing & yet no sort of creatures has these members to no purpose. What more difficult then to fly? & yet was it by chance that all creatures can fly which have wings? Certainly he that framed the eyes of all creatures understood the nature of light & vision he that framed their ears understood the nature of sounds & hearing, he that framed their noses understood the nature of odours & smelling, he that framed the wings of flying creatures & the fins of fishes understood the force of air & water & what members were requisite to enable creatures to fly & swim: & therefore the first formation of every species of creatures must be ascribed to an intelligent being These & such like considerations are the most convincing arguments for such a being & have convinced mankind in all ages that the world & all the species of things therein were originally framed by his power & wisdom. And to lay aside this argument is unphilosophical.
Another Principle is that matter is impenitrable by matter. This is usually looked upon as a maxim known to us by the light of nature, altho we {know} nothing of bodies but by sense. We find by dayly experience that bodies resist one another as often as they come together & cannot by any force be made <479v> to penetrate one anothers dimensions. And this holding true without exception in all bodies here below in which we can come to make observations we conclude it to be the property of all bodies whatsoever. And such observations occurring every day to every man this property of bodies is acknowledged by all men without any dispute & looked upon as an Axiom.
A third principle is that all bodies in the Vniverse have a tendency towards one another proportional to the quantity of matter conteined in them & that this tendency in receding from the body decreases & is reciprocally proportional to the square of the distance from the body: [And all small bodies have the like tendency towards the great ones This tendency towards the earth we find in all bodies here below & call it gravity] Such a tendency towards the earth we find in all bodies here below & call it gravity. & by experiments of the Pendulum & of falling bodies we find it exactly proportional to the quantity of matter in the several bodies We find it also in the Moon, the force which keeps her in her Orb being reciprocally . The like tendency towards proportionall to the square of her distance from the earth Iupiter we find in his four satellites which are thereby kept in their Orbs about him & this tendency by comparing the Orbs & Revolutions of the Satellites together is proportional to the matter in the Satellites reciprocally as the squares of their distances from Iupiter. The like tendency to Saturn we find in his five Satellites, proportional directly to their matter & in reciprocally to the {squares} of their distances. And all the Planets both primary & secondary & so many Comets as have been well observed appear to have the same tendency towards the Sun proportional directly to the matter in each of them & reciprocally to their distances from the sun. And by the rest or very small motion of the Aphelia of the Planets it appears that this tendency of the Planets towards Iupiter Saturn & the Sun & of the Moon towards the earth decreases in receding
[Editorial Note 2]
. . .
A fourth Principle is that all sensible bodies are aggregated of particles laid together with many interstices or pores between them For water soaks into the pores of all animal & vegetable substances & some minerals & quicksilver into the pores of Metall & acid liquors into the pores of all minerals & metals in dissolving them, & light passes through aire, water oyles salt {spars} sand glass crystal gemms & all other pellucid substances & through the particles of all metals & minerals dissolved in pellucid menstruums or vitrified & through thin pieces of wood, flesh, bone horn stone & vitrified earth. As by the third Principle we gave an account heretofore of the motions of the Planets & of the flux & reflux of the sea, so by this Principle we shall in the following treatise give an acct of the permanent colours of natural bodies, nothing further being requisite for the production of those colours then that the coloured bodies abound with pellucid particles of a certain size & density. This is to be understood of the largest particles or particles of the last composition. For as bodies are composed of these larger particles with larger pores between them so it is to be conceived that these larger particles are composed of smaller particles with smaller pores between them. And when water dissolves salts & acid menstruum or quicksilver dissolves metals it is to be conceived that the liquor enters the larger pores & separates the larger particles of the salt or metal from one another without soaking into the smaller particles

As Mathematicians have two Methods of doing things which they call Composition and Resolution & in all difficulties have recourse to their method of resolution before they compound so in explaining the Phænomena of nature the like methods are to be used & he that expects success must resolve before he compounds. For the explications of Phænomena are Problems much harder then those in Mathematicks. The method of Resolution consists in trying experiments & considering all the Phænomena of nature relating to the subject in hand & drawing conclusions from them & examining the truth of those conclusions by new experiments & drawing new conclusions (if it may be) from those experiments & so proceeding alternately from experiments to conclusions & from conclusions to experiments untill you come to the general properties of things, [& by experiments & phænomena have established the truth of those properties] Then assuming those properties as Principles of Philosophy you may by them explain the causes of such Phænomena as follow from them: which is the method of Composition. But, if without deriving the properties of things from Phænomena you feign Hypotheses & think by them to explain all nature you may make a plausible systeme of Philosophy for getting your self a name, but your systeme will be little better then a Romance. ‡ To explain all nature is too difficult a task for any one man or even for any one age. Tis much better to do a little with certainty & leave the rest for others that come after you then to explain all things by conjecture without making sure of any thing.
Thus in Mathematical Principles of Philosophy I first shewed from Phænomena that all bodies endeavour by a certain force proportional to their matter to approach ane another, that this force in receding from the body grows less & less in reciprocal proportion to the square of the distance from it & that it is equal to gravity & therefore is one & the same force with gravity. Then using this force as a Principle of Philosophy I derived from it all the motions of the heavenly bodies & the flux & reflux of the sea, shewing by mathematical demonstrations that this force alone was sufficient to produce all those Phænomena, & deriving from it (a priori) some new motions which Astronomers had not then observed but since appeare to be true, as that Saturn & Iupiter draw one another, that the Variation of the Moon is bigger in winter then in summer, that there is an equation of the Moons meane motion amounting to almost 5 minutes which depends upon the position of her Apoge of the Sun.

Seignr Rizzetti in the beginning of his paper writes thus. Newtonus cum lumini Solis objecisset Prisma triangulare, agravit spectrum Solis magis produce quam lex vulgata refractionis postulasset: ideoq3 lumen solis in refractione dispergi, ita ut unicus simplexq3 radius in plures discindatur. 
But Newton affirms no such thing. He represents that every ray emitted from the Sun or other lucid body, continues one & the same without any dispersion or splitting by refraction or change in repect of refrangibility or colour. For in his first Definition, he calls the Rays of light its least parts, whether successive in the same lines or contemporary in several lines. And in his second Proposition he brings his 5t, 6t, 7th, 8th, 9th & 10th Experiments to prove that one & the same ray is not by refraction disturbed shattered, dilated split or spread into many rays. And his first Proposition is that homogeneal light is refracted regularly without any dilatation splitting or shattering of the Rays.
He saith further that if the breadth of the image of a lucid point cast upon the bottom of the eye were about the 55th part of the bread of the pupill of the eye the hair of a mans head could not appear so distinct as it really doth; & then he adds. Cum dixerim in visione capilli locum minima esse aberratio ni Newtonianæ quia minime cernitur, adversus hujusmodi argumentum rationabilior mihi videretur objectio ducta a Propositione VII Autoris: nimirum adeo extenuari lumen aberrans in distantia a suo centro, ut (loquar Newtoni verbis) non sit sensibile nisi in eodem centro aut prope illud. Vt objectioni respondeam, divisa semidiametro luminis aberrantis in undecim partes equales; ejus densitas juxta Newtonianam sententiam, decresit in talam Arithmeticam proportionem, ut cum expressa sit in prima parte a numero 21, exprimatur in secunda a numero 19, & sic deinceps, adeo ut in parte ultima exteriori exprimatur per unitatem. And yet Mr Newton affirms no such Arithmetical proportion. His Rule is that the density of the light at any distance from the center is as the distance of that point from the circumference applied to its distance from the center. Let the semidiameter of the erring light be divided into eleven equal parts, & the density of the light in the midle of the part next the center will be to its density in the middle of the part next the circumference not as 21 to 1 but as  to  or as 441 to 1
He saith further. Vidit sapientissimus Anglus speciem solarem magis in longum porrectam quam lex vulgaris refractionis postulasset cumq3 illam cerneret diversicolorem, scilicet rubram, mox flavam, deinde viridem, postea cæruleam, & tandem supra violaceam, hoc experimento fretus suum confecit systema luminis atq3 colorum. Omnia experimenta, quibus illud innixum est, renovare curari, & ea (prologu{illeg} id licet?) partim falsa, & omnia reliqua inveni propter omissionem ––– alicujus circumstantiæ æquivoca ac minime concludentia. Vt unicum [experimentum] allendas obsecro. Then he describes the experiment of painting a chart with red & blue colours & casting the species thereof through a Lens upon which paper as is described above & denies the success. If it did not succeed with him it was because he did not know perfectly well as is described above. He should have told the world that Newton founded his Theory of light & colours upon the experiment which for its demonstrative evidence he calls experimentum crucis. This experiment he could not deny because it hath been tried again & again with full success both in France & in Italy as well as in England: & therefore he passes it by in silence & denies the conclusion drawn from it, & contrary to the <481r> Rules of Logic disputes against the conclusion without taking note of the Premisses.

Draft of the 'Discourse Concerning Light and Colors'
Sir
I suppose you understand that all transparent substances (as Glass water, Air &c) when made very thin by being blown into bubbles or otherwise formed into plates, doe exhibit various colours according to their various thinnesse, although at a greater thicknesse they appeare very cleare & colourlesse. In my former discourse about the constitution of light, I ommited these colours, because they seemed of a more difficult consideration, & were not necessary for establishment of the Doctrine which I propounded. But because they may conduce to further discoveries for completing that Theory, especially as to the constitution of the parts of naturall bodies on which their colours or transparency depend, I have now sent you an account of them. To render this discourse short & distinct, I have first described the principal of my Observations, & then considered & made use of them. The Observations are these:
Obs: 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which by chance were a very little convex) might somewhere touch one another, I found the place in which they touched to become absolutely transparent as if they had there been one continued piece of Glasse. For when the light fell so obliquely on the Air which in other places was between them, as to be all reflected; it seemed in that place of contact to be wholly transmitted: in so much that when looked upon it appeared like a black or dark spot by reason that little or no sensible light was reflected from thence as from other places; & when looked through it seemed (as it were,) a hole in that Air which was formed into a thin plate by being compressed between the glasses. And through this hole Objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly which could not at all be seen through other parts of the glasses where the Air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex yet this transparent spot was of a considerable breadth, which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yeilding inwards of the parts of the glasses by reason of their mutuall pressure For by pressing them very hard together it would become much broader then otherwise.
Obs: 2. When the plate of Air, by turning the Prisms about their common Axis became so little inclined by the incident rays, that some of them began to be transmitted, there arose in it many slender arcs of colours which at first were shaped almost like a Conchoid as you see them here delineated.  And by continuing the motion of the Prisms, these arcs increased & bended more & more about the said transparent spot, till they were completed into circles or rings incompassing it, & afterwards continually <501v> grew more & more contracted.
These arcs at their first appearance were of a violet & blew colour, & between them were white arcs of circles which presently (by continuing the motion of the Prisms) became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red & yellow, & to their outward limbs the blew was adjacent. So that the order of these colours from the centrall dark spot, was at that time White, Blew, Violet; Black ; Red, Orange, Yellow, White, Blew, Violet; &c. But the Yellow & Red were much fainter then the Blew & Violet.
The motion of the Prisms about their Axis being continued these colours contracted more & more, shrinking towards the whitenesse on either side of it untill they totally vanished into it. And then the circles in those parts appeared black & white without any other colours intermixed. But by further moving the Prisms about, the colours again emerged out of the whitenesse, the violet & blew at its ––– inward limb, & at its outward limb the red & yellow. So that now their order from the centrall spot was White, Yellow, Red; Black; Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, Red, &c. contrary to what it was before.
Obs: 3 When the rings or some parts of them appeared only black & white, they were very distinct & well defined, & the blacknesse seemed as intense as that of the centrall spot. Also in the borders of the rings where the colours began to emerge out of the whitenesse, they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty successions (recconing every black & white ring for one succession,) & seen more of them which by reason of their smallnesse I could not number. But in other positions of the Prisms at which the rings appeared of many colours, I could not distinguish above 8 or 9 of them, & the exteriour of those were very confused & dilute.
In these two Observations to see the rings distinct, & without any other colour but black & white, I found it necessary to hold my eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye to the plane of the rings, yet there emerged a blewish colour out of the white, which by dilating it selfe more & more into the black rendered the circles lesse distinct, & left the white a little tinged with red & yellow. I found also that by looking through a slit or oblong hole which was narrower then the pupill of my eye & held close to it parallel to the Prisms, I could see the circles much distincter & visible to a far greater number then otherwise.
Obs: 4. To observe more nicely the order of the colours which arose out of the white circles as the rays became lesse & lesse inclined to the plate of Air; I took two object glasses the one a plano-convex for a fourteen foot Telescope, & the other a large double convex for one of about fifty foot, & upon this laying the other with its plane side downwards, I pressed them slowly together to make the colours succes <502r> sively emerge in the middle of the circles & then slowly lifted the upper glasse from the lower to make them successively vanish again in the same place, where being of a considerable breadth, I could more easily discerne them. And by this means I observed their succession & quantity to be as followeth.
Next to the pellucid centrall spot made by the contact of the glasses, succeeded , Blew, White, Yellow, & Red. The Blew was so very little in quantity that I could not discerne it in the circles made by the Prisms, nor could I well distinguish any violet in it,, but the Yellow & Red were pretty copious & seemed about as much in extent as the white, & foure or five times more then the Blew . The next circuit or order of colours immediately incompassing these was Violet Blew, Green, Yellow, & Red. And these were all of them copious & vivid excepting the green which was very little in quantity & seemed much more faint & dilute then the other colours. Of the other four the Violet was least & the blew lesse then the yellow or red. The third circuit or order was also Purple, Blew, Green, Yellow, & Red in which the purple seemed more reddish then the Violet in the former circuit, & the Green was much more conspicuous, being as brisque & copious as any of the other colours except the Yellow, but the Red began to be a little faded inclining very much to purple. After these succeeded in the fourth circuit Green & Red. The Green was very copious & lively, inclining on one side to blew & on the other to yellow. But in this 4th circuit there was neither violet blew nor yellow, & the Red was very imperfect & dirty. Also the succeeding colours became more & more imperfect & dilute till after three or four more revolutions they ended in perfect whitenesse.
Obs: 5. To determin the intervall of the glasses or thicknesse of the interjacent Air by which each colour was produced, I measured the diameters of the first six rings at the most lucid part of their Orbits, & squaring them I found their squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. And since one of the glasses was plane & the other sphericall, their intervalls at those rings must be in the same progression. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint rings between the more lucid colours & found their squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the eaven numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. And it being very nice & difficult to take these measures exactly I repeated them divers times at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same Method I used in determining some others of the following Observations.
Obs: 6. The diameter of the sixt ring at the most lucid part of its orbit was  parts of an inch, & the diameter of the Sphere <502v> on which the double convex object glass was ground was 102 foot, as I found by measuring it; & consequently the thicknesse of the Air, or Aereall intervall of the glasses at that ring was  of an inch. For as the diameter of the said sphere (102 foot or 1224 inches) is to the semidiameter of the ring  so very nearely is that semi-diameter to  the said intervall of the glasses. Now by the preceedent Observation the eleventh part of this intervall () is the thicknesse of the Air at that part of the first ring where most lucid of the colours the citrine Yellow would be most vivid were it nor mixed with other colours in the white of this ring, & this doubled gives the difference of its thicknesses at the citrine Yellow in all the other rings. viz  or to use a round number, the eighty thousandth part of an inch.
Obs: 7. These dimensions were taken when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses in or neare the axis of the Rings But when I viewed them obliquely they became bigger, continually swelling as I removed my eye further from their Axis. And partly by measuring the diameter of the same circle at severall obliquities of my eye, partly by other meanes, as also by making use of the two Prisms for very great obliquities, I found its diameter, & consequently the thicknesse of the Air at its perimeter in all those obliquities to be very nearly in the proportions expressed in this Table
Angle of  Incidence  on the Air.Angle of  Refraction  into the Air.Diameter  of the Ring.Thicknesse  of the Air. 00gr. 00min00gr. 00g min.10.10. 6. 26.10. 00... 12. 45.20. 00... 18. 49.30. 00... 24. 30.40. 00..13. 29. 37.50. 00... 33. 58.60. 00.14.20. 35. 47.65. 00... 37. 19.70. 00... 38. 33.75. 00..37. 39. 2780. 00... 40. 085. 00.29.. 40. 1190. 00.35.. 
In the two first Columns are expressed the obliquities of the incident & emergent rays to the Plate of Air, that is their angles of incidence & refraction. In the third Column the diameter of any coloured Ring at those obliquities is exprest in parts of which ten constitute th at diameter when the rays are perpendicular. And in the 4th Column the thicknesse of the Air at the circumference of that Ring is exprest in parts of which also 10 constitute that thicknesse when the rays are perpendicular.
<503r>
Obs: 8. The dark spot in the middle of the Rings increased also by the obliquation of the eye; although almost insensibly. But if instead of the Object-glasses the Prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest when viewed so obliquely that no colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent Air, & as the obliquity decreased it increased more & more untill the coloured rings appeared, & then decreased again, but not so much as it increased before. And hence it is evident that the transparency was not onely at the absolute contact of the glasses but also where they had some little intervall. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between half & two fift parts of the diameter of the exterior circumference of the Red in the first circuit or revolution of colours when viewed almost perpendicularly; whereas when viewed obliquely it hath wholly vanished & become opake & white like the other parts of the glasse. Whence it may be collected that the glasses did then scarcely or not at all touch one another, & that their intervall at the perimeter of that spot when viewed perpendicularly was about a 5t or a 6t part of their intervall at the circumference of the said Red
Obs: 9. By looking through the two contiguous Object-glasses, I found that the interjacent Air exhibited Rings of colours as well by transmitting light as by reflecting it. The centrall spot was now white, & from it the order of the colours were Yellowish Red; Black; Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, Red; Violet, Blew, Green, Yellow, Red, &c But these colours were very faint & dilute unlesse when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses. For by that meanes they became pretty vivid. Onely the first Yellowish Red, like the blew in the 4th Observation was so little & faint as scarcely to be discerned. Compareing the coloured Rings made by reflexion, with these made by transmission of the light; I found that White was opposite to Black, Red to Blew, Yellow to Violet, & Green to a compound of Red & Violet. That is, those parts of the glasse were black when looked at through which when looked upon appeared white, & on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited blew did in the other case exhibit Red. And the like of the other colours.
Obs: 10. Wetting the Object glasses a little at their edges, the water crept in slowly between them, & the circles thereby became lesse & the colours more faint: in so much that as the water crept along one half of them at which it first arrived would appeare broken of from the other half & contracted into a lesse Room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by Air to be about seven to eight, & consequently the intervalls of the glasses at like circles caused by these two Mediums water & air are as about three to four. Perhaps it may {be} <503v> a generall Rule that if any other Medium more or lesses dense yn water be compressed between the glasses, their intervall at the Rings caused thereby will be to their intervall caused by the interjacent Air, as the sines are which measure the refraction made out of that Medium into Air
Obs: 11. When the water was between the glasses if I pressed the upper glasse variously at its edges to make the Rings move nimbly from one place to another, a little bright spot would –––– immediately follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish. It's appearance was such as interjacent Air would have caused, & it exhibited the same colours. But it was not Air, for where any aereall bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must rather have been caused by a subtiler Medium which could recede through the Glasse at the creeping in of the water.
Obs: 12. These Observations were made in the open Air. But further to examin the effects of coloured light falling on the Glasses, I darkened the Room & viewed them by reflexion of the colours of a Prism cast on a sheet of white paper my eye being so placed that I could see the coloured paper by reflexion in the glasses as in a looking glass.. And by this meanes the Rings became distincter & visible to a far greater number then in the open Air. I have sometimes seen more then 20 of them, whereas in the open Air I could not discerne above 8 or 9.
Obs: 13. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to & fro about its Axis, that all the colours might successively fall on that plart of the paper which I saw by reflexion from that part of the glasses where the circles appeared so that all the colours might be successively reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles which the Red light made to be manifestly biger then those which were made by the Blew & Violet. And it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The interval of the Glasses at any of the rings when they were made by the utmost red light was to their intervall at the same Ring when made by the utmost Violet, greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 13 to 8. By the most of my Observations it was as 14 to 9. And this proportion seemed very nearely the same in all obliquities of my eye; unlesse when two Prisms were made use of instead of the Object-glasses. For then at a certain great obliquity of my eye the Rings made by the severall colours seemed equall, & at a greater obliquity those made by the Violet would be greater then the same Rings made by the Red.
Obs 14. While the Prism was turned about its axis with an eaven motion The Contraction or dilatation of a Ring made by all the severall colours of the Prism successively reflected from the Object-Glasses, was swiftest in the Red, slowest in the Violet, & in intermediate colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. Comparing the extent or breadth of the rings or variation of the Air's thickness which each colour obteined moved over & took up by this contraction or dilatation <504r> I found that the Blew was sensibly more extended then the Violet, the Yellow then the Blew, & the Red then the Yellow. And to make a juster estimation of their proportions I observed that the extent or breadth of the Red squared that is the variation of the thickness of the air where all the red by contraction & dilatation appeared was almost double to that of the Violet, & that the light was of a middle colour between Yellow & Green at that intervall of the Glasses which was an Arithmeticall mean between the two extreame intervalls where the colours began & ended: contrary to what happens in the colours made by the refraction of a Prism, where the Red is most contracted, the Violet most expanded, & in the midst of all the colours is the confine of Green & Blew.
Obs: 15. These Rings were not of various colours like those in the open Air but appeared all over of that Prismatique colour onely with which they were illuminated. And by projecting the Prismatique colours immediately upon the glasses, I found that the light which fell on the dark spaces which were between the coloured Rings, was transmitted through the Glasses without any variation of colour. For on a white paper placed behind, it would paint Rings of the same colour with those which were reflected, & of the bignesse of their intermediate spaces. And from hence the origine of these Rings is manifest, namely that the aereall intervall of the glasses, according to its various thicknesse, is disposed in some places to reflect, & in others to transmit the light of any colour, & in the same place to reflect one colour where it transmits another.
Obs: 16. The squares of the diameters of these Rings made by any Prismatique colour were in Arithmeticall Progression as in the 5t Observation. And the diameter of the sixt circle when made by the citrine Yellow & viewed almost perpendicularly, was about  parts of an inch, agreable to the 6t Observation. 
The precedent Observations were made with a rarer thin Medium terminated by a denser, such as was Air or water ––– comprest between two Glasses. In those that follow are set down the appearances of a denser Medium thin'd within a rarer, such as are Plates of Moscovy Glasse, Bubbles of Water, & some other thin substances terminated as all sides with Air
Obs: 17. If a Bubble be blown with water, first made tenacious by dissolving a little soape in it, tis a common observation that after a while it will appeare tinged with a great variety of colours. To defend these bubbles from being agitated by the externall Air (whereby their colours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no accurate observation can be made of them,) as soon as I had blown any of them I covered it with a cleare glasse, & by that meanes its colours emerged in a very regular order like so many concentrick rings incompassing the top of the Bubble. And <504v> as the bubble grew thinner by the continuall subsiding of the water these rings dilated slowly & overspread the whole bubble descending in order to the bottom of it where they vanished successively. In the meane while after all the colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the center of the Rings a small round black spot like that in the first Observation which continually dilated it selfe till it became sometimes more then  or  of an inch in breadth before the Bubble brake. At first I thought there had been no light reflected from the water in that place, but observing it more curiously I saw within it severall smaller round spots which appeared much blacker & darker then the rest, whereby I knew that there was some reflexion at the other places which were not so dark as those spots. And by further tryall I found that I could see the images of some things (as of a candle or the Sun) very faintly reflected not onely from the great black spot but also from the little darker spots which were within it.
Besides the afforesaid coloured Rings there would often appeare small spots of colours ascending & descending up & down the sides of the Bubble, by reason of some inequalities in the subsiding of the water. And sometimes small black spots generated at the sides would ascend up to the larger black spot at the top of the Bubble & unite with it.
Obs: 18. Because the colours of these Bubbles were more extended & lively then those of Air thind between two Glasses, & so more easy to be distinguished: I shall here give you a further description of their order as they were observed in viewing them by reflexion of the Skies when of a white colour, whilst a black substance was placed behind the bubble. And they were these; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Green; Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, Purple; Red, Yellow, Green, Blew, Violet; Red, Yellow, White, Blew, Black.
The three first successions of Red & Blew were very dilute & dirty, especially the first where the Red seemed in a manner to be white Amongst these there was scarcely any other colour sensible, onely the Blews (& principally the second blew) inclined a little to Green.
The fourth Red was also dilute & dirty but not so much as the former three; After that succeeded little or no Yellow, but a copious Green which at first inclined a little to yellow, & then became a pretty brisque & good Willow Green, & afterwards changed to a blewish colour; but there succeeded neither Blew nor violet.
The fift Red at first inclined very much to purple & afterwards became more bright & brisque but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with a very bright & intense Yellow, which was but little in quantity, & soon changed to Green: But that Green was {copious} & something more pure deep & lively then the former Green. After <505r> that followed an excellent Blew of a bright Sky colour, & then a Purple which was lesse in quantity then the Blew & much inclined to Red.
The sixt Red was at first of a very faire & lively Scarlet, & soon after of a brighter colour being very pure & brisque & the best of all the Reds. Then after a lively Orange followed an intense bright & copious Yellow, which was also the best of all the Yellows; & this changed first to a Greenish Yellow, & then to a Greenish Blew; but the Green between the Yellow & Blew was very little & dilute, seeming rather a Greenish White then a Green. The Blew which succeeded became very good & of a fair Bright Sky colour, but yet something inferior to the former Blew, And the Violet was intense & deepe with little or no rednesse in it And lesse in quantity then the Blew
In the last Red appeared a tincture of Scarlet next the Violet, which soon changed to a brighter colour inclining to an Orange; And the Yellow which followed was at first pretty good & lively but afterwards it grew more & more dilute untill by degrees it ended in perfect whitenesse. And this whitenesse, if the water was very tenacious & well tempered, would slowly spread & dilate it selfe over the greatest part of the bubble, continually growing paler at the top, where at length it would crack in many places, & those cracks as they dilated would appeare of a pretty good, but yet obscure & dark sky colour; the white between the Blew spots diminishing, untill it resembled the threds of an irregular net=work, & soon after vanished & left all the upper part of the Bubble of the said dark Blew colour. And this colour after the afforesaid manner dilated it self downwards untill sometimes it hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the meane-while at the top, which was of a darker Blew then the bottom & appeared also full of many round blew spots something darker then the rest, there would emerge one or more very black spots & with those other spots of an intenser blacknesse, which I mentioned in the former Observation; And these continually dilated themselves untill the Bubble brake.
If the water was not very tenacious the Black spots would break forth in the white without any sensible intervention of the blew. And sometimes they would break forth within the precedent Yellow, or Red, or perhaps within the Blew of the second order before the intermediate colours had time to display themselves.
By this description you may perceive how great an affinity these colours have with those of Air described in the 4th Observation, although set down in a contrary order by reason that they begin to appeare when the Bubble is the thickest, & are most conveniently recconed from the lowest & thickest part of the Bubble upwards.
Obs: 19. Viewing at severall oblique positions of my eye the Rings of colours emerging on the top of the Bubble, I found that they <505v> were sensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity, but yet not so much by far as those made by thinned Air in the 7th Observation. For there they were dilated so much as, when viewed most obliquely, to arrive at a part of the Plate more then twelve times thicker then that where they appeared when viewed perpendicularly, whereas in this case the thicknesse of the water at which they arrived when viewed most obliquely, was to that thicknesse which exhibited them by perpendicular rays something lesse then 8 to 5. By the best of my Observations it was between 15 &  to 10; an increase about 24 times lesse then in the other case.
Sometimes the Bubble would become of an uniform thicknesse all over except at the top of it neare the black spot, as I knew because it would exhibit the same appeareance of colours in all ––– positions of the eye: And then the colours which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays would be different from those that were seen in other places by rays lesse oblique to it. And divers Spectators might see the same part of it differing colours by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now observing how much the colours at the same place of the Bubble or at divers places of equall thicknesse were varied by the severall obliquities of the rays; by assistance of the 4th 14th 16th & 18th Observations, as they are hereafter explained, I collected the thicknesse of the water requisite to exhibit any one & the same colour at severall obliquities to be very nearely in the proportion expressed in this Table.
Incidence  on the Water.Refraction  into the Water.Thicknesse  of the water. 00degr.. 00min.00degr.. 00min.10. 15. 00.11. 11.. 30. 00.22. 1.. 45. 00.32. 2.. 60. 00.40. 30.13. 75. 00.46. 25.. 90. 00.48. 35.. 
In the first two Collumns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the superficies of the water, that is their angles of incidence & refraction. Where I suppose that the sines which measure them are in round numbers as 3 to 4, though probably the dissolution of soape in the water may a little alter its refractive virtue. In the third collumn the thicknesses of the Bubble at which any one colour is exhibited in those severall obliquities, is exprest an parts of which ten constitute that thicknesse when the rays are perpendicular.
I have sometimes observed of the colours which arise on polished Steel when heating it, or on Belmstall & some other Metalline substances when melted & poured on the ground <506r> where it may cook in the open Air, that they have, like these of water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers obliquities, & particulary that a deep blew of violet when viewed very obliquely hath been changed to a deep Red. But the changes of these colours are not so great & sensible as of those made by water. For the Scoria or vitrified part of the Metall which most Metalls when heated or melted do continually protrude to their surface & which by covering the metalls in forme of a thin glassy skin, causes these colours, is much denser then water; and I find that the change made by the obliquation of the eye is least in colours of the densest thin substances.
Obs: 20. As in the 9th Observation so here the Bubble by transmitted light appeared of a contrary colour to that which it exhited by reflexion. Thus when the Bubble being looked on by the light of the clouds reflected from it, seemed Red at its apparent circumference, if the clouds at the same time or immediately after were viewed through it, the colour at its circumference would be Blew. And on the contrary when by reflected light it appeared Blew, it would appeare Red by transmitted light.
Obs: 21. By wetting very thin Plates of Moscovy-glasse whose thinnesse made the like colours appeare, the colours became more faint; especially by wetting the Plates on that side opposite to the eye; but I could not perceive any variation of their species. So then the thicknesse of a plate requisite to produce any colour depends only on the density of the Plate & not on that of the ambient Medium. And hence by the 10th & 16th Observations may be known the thicknesse which Bubbles of Water or plates of Moscovy-glasse, or other substances, have at any colour produced by them.
Obs: 22. A thin transparent body which is denser then its ambient Medium, exhibits more brisque & vivid colours then that which is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in Air & Glasse. For blowing Glasse very thin at a Lamp Furnace, those plates incompassed with Air did exhibit colours much more vivid then those of Air made thin between two glasses.
Obs: 23. Comparing the quantity of light reflected from the severall Rings, I found it was most copious from the first or inmost, & in the exterior Rings became gradually lesse & lesse. Also the whitenesse of the first Ring was stronger then that reflected from those parts of the thinned Medium which were without the Rings; as I could manifestly perceive by viewing at a distance the Rings made by the two Object glasses; Or by compareing two bubbles of water blown at distant times in the first of which the whitenesse appeared which succeded all the colours, & in the other the whitenesse which preceded them all .
Obs: 24. When the two Object-Glasses were layd upon one another so as to make the Rings of Colours appeare, though with my naked eye I <506v> could not discerne above 8 or 9 of those rings yet by viewing them through a Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch that I could number more then fourty besides many others that were so very small & close together that I could not keep my eye so steddy on them severally as to number them. But by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more then a hundred. And I beleive the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, though visible onely so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter explaine.
But it was but one side of these rings, namely that towards which the refraction was made, which by that refraction was rendered distinct, & the other side became more confused then when viewed by the naked eye, insomuch that there I could not discerne above one or two, & sometimes none of those rings, of which I could discerne 8 or 9 with my naked eye. And their segments or arcs which on the other side ––– appeared so numerous, for the most part exceed ed not the third part of a circle. If the refraction was very great or the Prisms very distant from the Object-glasses, the middle part of those arcs became also confused so as to disappeare & constitute an eaven whitenesse, whilst on either side their ends , as also the  whole arcs furthest from the center became distincter then before, appearing in the forme you see them here designed.
The arcs when they seemed distinctest were onely white & black successively without any other colours intermixed. But in other places there appeared colours whose order was inverted by the refraction in such manner that if I first held the Prism very neare the Object-Glasses & then gradually removed it further of towards my eye, the colours of the 2d 3d 4th & following Rings shrunk towards the white that emerged between them, untill they wholly vanished into it at the middle of the arcs, & afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. But at the ends of the arcs they retained their order unchanged.
I have sometimes so layd one Object-glasse upon the other that to the naked eye they have all over seemed uniformly white without the least appearance of any of the coloured rings; & yet by viewing them through a Prism great multitudes of those rings have discovered themselves. And in like manner Plates of Moscovy-Glasse & bubbles of Glasse blown at a Lamp-Furnace which were not so thin as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up & down in the form of waves. And so bubbles of water before they began to exhibit their colours to the naked eye of a by stander have appeared through a Prism, girded about with many parallel & horizontal Rings; to produce which effect, it was necessary to hold the Prism parallel or very nearely parallel to the Horizon, & to dispose it so that the rays might be refracted upwards.

The second Part  Remarks upon the foregoing Observations.
Having given my Observations of these colours, before I make use of them to unfold the causes of the colours of naturall bodies, it is convenient that by the simplest of them, such as are the 2d, 3d, 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th 20th & 24th, I first explaine the more compounded. And first to show how the colours in the 4th & 18th Observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line the lengths YZ, YA, & YH in proportion as  4, 9, & 14 | 2 5 & 8 & between ZA & ZH eleven meane proportionalls, of which let ZB be the second, ZC the third, ZD the fift, ZE the seventh, ZF the ninth, & ZG the tenth. And at the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H let perpendiculars Aα, Bβ &c be erected, by whose intervalls the extent of the severall colours set underneath against them, is to be represented. Then divide the line Aα in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3; 5, 6, 7; 9, 10, 11; &c. set at the points of division denote. And through those divisions from Y draw lines 1I, 2K, 3L; 5M, 6N, 7O; &c
Now if A2 be supposed to represent the thicknesse of any thin transparent body at which the outmost Violet is most copiously reflected in the first Ring or series of colours, then by the 13th Observation HK will represent its thicknesse at which the outmost Red is most copiously reflected in the same series. Also by the 5t & 16 Observations A6 & HN will denote the thicknesses at which those extreme colours are most copiously –––– reflected in the second series, & A10. HQ the thicknesses at which they are most copiously reflected in the third series & so on. And the thicknesse at which any of the intermediate colours are reflected most copiously, will according to the 14 Observation be defined by the distance of the line AH from the intermediate parts of the lines 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c against which the names of those colours are written below.
But further to define the latitude of these colours in each Ring or series, let A{2} designe the least thicknesse & A3 the greatest thicknesse at which the extreame Violet in the first series is reflected & let HI & HL designe the like limits for the extreame Red, & let <507v> the intermediate colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the lines 1I & 3L against which the names of those colours are written. And in the second series let those limits be the lines 5M & 7O; & so on: But yet with this caution that the reflexions be supposed strongest at the intermediate spaces 2K, 6N, 10Q &c & from thence to decrease gradually towards these limits 1I, 3L; 5M, 7O; &c on either side; where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited but to decay indefinitely. And whereas I have assigned the same latitude to every series, I did it because although the colours in the first series seem to be a little broader then the rest by reason of a stronger reflexion there, yet that inequality is so insensible as scarcely to be determined by observation.
Now according to this Description conceiving that the rays in which severall colours inhere are by turnes reflected at the spaces iIL3, 5MO7, 9PR11 &c:, & transmitted at the spaces AHI1, 3LM5, 7OP9 &c: it is easy to know what colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any thicknesse of a transparent thin Body. For if a Ruler be applyed parallel to AH at that distance from it by which the thicknesse of the Body is represented, the alternate spaces 1IL3, 5MO7 &c which it crosseth will denote the reflected originall colours of which the colour exhibited in the open Air is compounded. Thus if the constitution of the Green in the third series of colours be desired; apply the Ruler as you see at πρσ, φ, And by its passing through some of the Blew at π, & yellow at σ, as well as through the green at ρ, you may conclude that the green exhibited at that thicknesse of the Body is principally constituted of originall green, but not without a mixture of some Blew & Yellow.
By this meanes you may know how the colours from the center of the Rings outwards ought to succede in order as they were described in the 4th & 18th Observations. For if you move the Ruler gradually from AH through all distances, having past over the first space which denotes little or no reflexion to be made by thinnest substances, it will first arrive at 1 the Violet, & then very quickly at the blew & Green which together with that Violet compound blew, & then at the Yellow & Red by whose further addition that Blew is converted into whitenesse, which whitenesse continues during the transit of the edge of the ruler from I to 3, & after that by the successive deficience of its component colours turnes first to compound Yellow & then to Red, & last of all the Red ceaseth at L. Then begin the colours of the second series, which succeed in order during the transit of the edge of the ruler from 5 & O , & are more lively then before because more expanded & severed. And for the same reason instead of the former white there intercedes between the blew & Yellow a mixture of Orange, Yellow, Green, Blew & Indico, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute & imperfect Green. So the colours of <508r> the third series all succeed in order; first the Violet which a little interferes with the Red of the second order & is thereby inclined to a reddish Purple; then the Blew & Green which are lesse mixed with other colours & consequently more lively then before, especially the Green: Then follows the Yellow some of which towards the Green is distinct & good, but that part of it towards the succeding Red, as also that Red is mixed with the Violet & Blew of the fourth series, whereby various degrees of Red very much inclining to Purple are compounded. This Violet & Blew which should succeed this Red being mixed with & hidden in it, there succeeds a Green, And this at first is much inclined to Blew, but soon becomes a good Green, the onely unmixt & lively colour in this fourth series. For as it verges towards the Yellow it begins to interfere with the colours of the fift series, by whose mixture the succeeding Yellow & Red are very much diluted & made dirty, especially the Yellow which being the weaker colour is scarce able to shew it selfe. After this the severall series interfere more & more & their colours become more & more intermixed, till after thre or four more revolutions (in which the Red & Blew ––– predominate by turnes) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended & compound an eaven whitenesse.
And since by the 15th Observation the rays indued with one colour are transmitted where those of another colour are reflected, the reason of the colours made by the transmitted light in the 9th & 20th Observations is also from hence evident.
If not onely the order & species of these colours, but also the precise thicknesse of the Plate or thin Body at which they are exhibited, be desired in parts of an inch, that may be also obteined by assistance of the 6t or 16th Observation. For according to those Observations the thicknesse of the thinned Air which between two Glasses exhibited the most luminous part of the sixt ring , was  parts of an inch. Now suppose this thicknesse be represented by G7 & the eleventh part of it Gλ will be about  of an inch. And so Gμ, Gν, Gξ, Gο will be , , , & . And this being known it is easy to determin what thicknesse of Air is represented by Gφ or by any other distance of the Ruler from AH.
But further since by the 10th Observation the thicknesse of Air was to the thicknesse of water which between the same Glasses exhibited the same colour, as 4 to 3; & by the 21th Observation the colours of thin Bodies are not varied by varying the ambient Medium: the thicknesse of a Bubble of water exhibiting any colour will be  of the thicknesse of Air produceing the same colour. And so according to the same 10th & 21th Observations the thicknesse of a Plate of Glasse whose refraction is measured by the proportion of the sines <508v> 31 to 20 may be  of the thicknesse of Air produceing the same colours. And the like of other Mediums. On these grounds I have composed the following Table wherein the thicknesse of Air, water, & glasse at which each colour is most intense & specific, is expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand equall parts.

Now if this Table be compared with the 3d Scheme [1] you will there see the constitution of each colour as to its ingredients or the originall colours of which it is compounded, & thence be enabled to judg of its intensenesse or imperfection, which may suffice in explication of the 4th & 18th Observations, unlesse it be further desired to delineate the manner how the colours appeare when the two Object-glasses are layd upon one another. To doe which let there be described a large Arc of a circle & a <509r> streight line which may touch that Arc, & parallel to that Tangent severall occult lines at such distances from it as the numbers set against the severall colours in the Table denote. For the Arc & its Tangent will represent the superficies of the glasses terminating the interjacent Air, & the places where the occult lines cut the Arc will show at what distances from the center or point of contact each colour is reflected.
There are also other uses of this Table: For by its assistance the Thicknesse of the Bubble in the 19th Observation was determined by the colours which it exhibited. And so the bignesse of the parts of naturall bodies may be conjectured at by their colours, as shall be hereafter shown. Also if two or more very thin Plates be layd one upon another so as to compose one Plate equalling them all in thicknesse, the resulting colour may be hereby determined. For instance, Mr Hook in his Micrographia observes that a faint yellow Plate of Moscovy-Glasse layd upon a blew one constituted a very deep purple. The Yellow of the first order is a faint one, & the thicknesse of the Plate exhibiting it, according to the Table, is  to which add  the thicknesse exhibiting Blew of the second order, & the summe will be , which is the thicknesse exhibiting the Purple of the third order.
To explain in the next place the circumstances of the 2d & 3d Observations, that is, how the rings of colours may, (by turning the Prisms about their common Axis the contrary way to that expressed in those Observations,) be converted into white & black Rings, & afterwards into rings of colours again the colours of each ring lying now in an inverted order: it must be remembered that those rings of colours are dilated by the obliquation of the rays to the Air which intercedes the Glasses, & that according to the Table in the 7th Observation their dilatation or increase of their diameter is most manifest & speedy when they are obliquest. Now the rays of Yellow being more refracted by the first superficies of the said Air then those of red are thereby made more oblique to the second superficies at which they are reflected to produce the coloured Rings, & consequently the Yellow circle in each Ring will be more dilated then the Red; & the excesse of its dilatation will be so much the greater by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rays, untill at last it become of equall extent with the Red of the same Ring. And for the same reason the Green blew & violet will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rays as to become all very nearely of equall extent with the Red, that is, equally distant from the center of the Rings. And then all the colours of the same ring must be coincident, & by their mixture exhibit a white Ring. And these white Rings must have black or dark Rings between them because they doe not spread & interfere with one another as before. <509v> And for that reason also they must become distincter & visible to far greater numbers. But yet the Violet being obliquest will be something more dilated in proportion to its extent then the other colours, & so very apt to appeare at the exterior verges of the white.
Afterwards by a greater obliquity of the rays, the Violet & Blew become sensibly more dilated then the Red & Yellow & so being further removed from the center of the Rings, the colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the Violet & Blew at the exterior limbs of each ring, & the Red & Yellow at the interior. And the Violet by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rays being in proportion most of all expanded will soonest appeare at the exterior limb of each white Ring & become more conspicuous then the rest. And the severall series of colours belonging to the several rings will by their unfolding & spreading begin again to interfere, & thereby render the Rings lesse distinct, & not visible to so great numbers.
If instead of the Prisms the Object-Glasses be made use of; the Rings which they exhibit become not white & distinct by the obliquity of the eye by reason that the rays in their passage through that Air which intercedes the Glasses are very nearely parallel to those lines in which they were first incident on the Glasses, & consequently the rays indued with severall colours are not inclined one more then another to that Air, as it happens in the Prisms.
There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered, & that is why the black & white Rings which when viewed at distance appeare distinct, should not onely become confused by viewing them neare at hand, but also yeild a Violet colour at both the edges of every white Ring. And the reason is that the rays which enter the eye at severall parts of the pupill, have severall obliquities to the Glasses, & those which are most oblique, if considered apart, would represent the Rings bigger then those which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the perimeter of every white Ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays, & inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of the obliquity; that is, by how much the Pupill is wider, or the Eye nearer to the Glasses. And the breadth of the Violet must be most expanded, because the rays apt to excite a sensation of that colour are most oblique to the second or further superficies of the thind Air at which they are reflected, & have also the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. And the breadth of every Ring is thus augmented, the dark intervalls must be diminished untill the neighbouring Rings become continuous, & are blended, the exterior first, & then those nearer center, so that they can no longer be distinguished apart but seem to constitute an eaven & uniform whitenesse.
<510r>
Amongst all the Observations there is none accompanied with so add circumstances as the 24th. Of those the principall are that in thin Plates which to the naked eye seem of an eaven & uniforme trans-parent whitenesse without any terminations of shadows, the refraction of a Prism should make Rings of colours appeare, whereas it usually makes Objects appeare coloured onely there where they are terminated with shaddows or have parts unequally luminous; & that it should make those Rings exceedingly distinct & white, although it usually renders Objects confused & coloured. The cause of these things you will understand by considering that all the Rings of colours are really in the Plate when viewed with the naked eye, although by reason of the great breadth of their circumferences they so much interfere & are blended together that they seem to constitute an eaven whitenesse. But when the rays passe through the Prism to the eye the orbits of the severall colours in every Ring are refracted some more then others according to their degrees of refrangibility: by which meanes the colours on one side of the Ring (that is on one side of its center) become more unfolded & dilated & those on the other side more complicated and contracted. And where by a due refraction they are so much contracted that the severall Rings become narrower then to interfere with one another, they must appeare distinct & also white if the constituent colours be so much contracted as to be wholly coincident. But on the other side where the orbit of every Ring is made broader by the further unfolding of its colours, it must interfere more with other Rings then before & so become lesse distinct.
To explaine this a little further suppose the concentrik circles AV & BX represent the red & Violet of any order which together with the intermediate colours constitute any one of these Rings. Now these being viewed through a Prism the violet circle BX will by a greater refraction be further translated from its place then the Red AV & so approach nearer to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance, if the Red be translated to av the Violet may be translated to bx so as to approach nearer to it at x then before, & if the Red be further translated to aV the Violet may be so much further translated to bX as to convene with it at X, & if the Red be yet further translated to αγ the Violet may be still so much further translated to βξ as to passe beyond it at ξ & convene with it at e & f. And this being understood not onely of the Red & Violet but of all the other intermediate colours, & also of every revolution of those colours, you will easily perceive how those of the same revolution or <510v> order by their nearenesse at xv & γξ, & their coincidence at XV, e, & f ought to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles, especially at XV or at e &f, & that they will appeare severall at xv & at XV exhibit whitenesse by their coincidence & again appeare severall at γξ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before & still retaine beyond e & f. But on the other side at ab, ab, or αβ these colours must become much more confused by being dilated & spread so as to interfere with those of the other orders. And the same confusion will happen at γξ between e & f if the refraction be very great, or the Prism very distant from the Object-Glasses: in which case no parts of the Ring will be seen save onely two little Arcs at e & f whose distance from one another will be augmented by removing the Prism still further from the Object-Glasses. And these little Arcs must be distinctest & whitest at their Middle, & at their ends where they begin to grow confused they must be coloured. And the colours at one end of every Arc must be in a contrary order to those at the other end, by reason that they crosse in the intermediate white. Namely their ends which verge towards γξ will be red & yellow on that side next the center, & blew & violet on the other side. But their other ends which verge from γξ will on the contrary be blew & violet on that side towards the center & on the other side red & yellow.
Now as all these things follow from the properties of light of a mathematical way of reasoning so the truth of them may be manifested by experiment. For in a dark Room by viewing these Rings through a Prism by reflexion of the severall Prismatique colour which an Assistant causes to move to & fro upon a wall or paper from whence they are reflected, whilst the spectators eye, the Prism and the Object glasses (as in the 13th Observation) are placed steddy: the position of the circles made successively by the severall colours will be found such in respect of one another as I have described in the figures abxv, or abXV, or αβξγ. And by the same method the truth of the explications of other Observations may be examined.
By what hath been said, the like Phænomena of Bubbles of water & thin Plates of Glasse may be understood. But in small fragments of those Plates, there is this further observable, that when lying flat upon a Table are turned about their centers whilst they are viewed through a Prism they will in some postures exhibit waves of various colours &: some of them do exhibit these waves in one or two {illeg} onely; but the most of them do in all positions exhibit {illeg} {illeg} thin the most part appeare almost all {illeg} <511r> the plates. The reason is that the superficies of such Plates are not eaven but have many cavities & swellings which how shallow soever do a little vary the thicknesse of the Plate: For at the severall sides of those cavities for the reasons newly described there ought to be produced waves in severall postures of the Prism. Now though it be but some very small & narrow parts of the Glasse by which these waves for the most part are caused, yet they may seem to extend themselves over the whole Glasse, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of severall orders that is of several rings confusedly reflected, which by refraction of the Prism are unfolded separated & according to their degrees of refraction, dispersed to severall places so as to constitute so many severall waves as there were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the Glasse.
These are the principall Phænomena of thin Plates or Bubbles whose explications depend on those properties of light which I have heretofore delivered. And these you see do necessarily follow from them & agree with them even to their very least circumstances; & not onely so, but do very much tend to their proof. Thus by the 24th Observation it appeares that the rays of severall colours made as well by thin Plates or Bubbles as by the refractions of a Prism have severall degrees of refrangibility whereby those of each order which at their reflexion from the Plate or Bubble are intermixed with those of the other orders, are separated from them by refraction, & associated together so as to become visible by themselves like Arcs of Circles. For if the rays were all alike refrangible, tis impossible that the whitenesse which to the naked sense appeares uniforme should by refraction have its parts transposed & ranged into those black & white Arcs.
It appeares also that the unequall refractions of difform rays proceed not from any contingent irregularities: Such as are Veines an uneaven polish, or fortuitous position of the pores of Glasse; unequall & casual motions in the Air or Æther; the spreading, breaking, or dividing the same ray into many diverging parts; or the like. For admitting any such irregularities, it would be impossible for refractions to render those Rings so very distinct & well defined as they doe in the 24th Observation. It is necessary therefore that every ray have its proper & constant degree of refrangibility connate with it, according to which its refraction is ever justly & regularly performed; & that severall rays have severall of those degrees.
And what is said of their Refrangibility may be also understood of their Reflexibility; that is of their dispositions to be reflected <511v> some at a greater & others at a lesse thicknessesse of thin Plates or Bubbles namely that those dispositions are also connate with the rays & immutable; as may appeare by the 13th 14th & 15th Observations compared with the 4th &18th.
By the precedent Observations it appeares also that whitenesse is a dissimilar mixture of all colours, & that light ia a mixture of rays indued with all those colours. For considering the multitude of the Rings of colours in the 3d, 12t, & 24th Observations, it is manifest that although in the 4th & 18th Observations there appeare no more then 8 or 9 of those Rings, yet there are really a far greater number which so much interfere & mingle with one another as after those 8 or 9 revolutions to dilute one another wholly & constitute an eaven & sensibly uniforme whitenesse. And consequently that whitenesse must be allowed a mixture of all colours, & the light which conveys it to the eye must be a mixture of rays indued with all those colours. 
But further by the 24th Observation it appeares that there is a constant relation between Colours & Refrangibility, the most refrangible rays being Violet, the least refrangible Red, & those of intermediate colours having proportionally intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th, & 15th Observations compared with the 4th or 18th, there appeares to be the same constant relation between Colour & Reflexibility, the Violet being in like circumstances reflected at least thicknesses of any thin Plate or Bubble, the Red at greatest thicknesses, & the intermediate colours at intermediate thicknesses. Whence it follows that the colorifique dispositions of rays are also connate with them & immutable, & by consequence that all the productions & appearances of colours in the world are derived not from any Physicall change caused in light by refraction or reflexion, but onely from the various mixtures or separations of rays by vertue of their different Refrangibility or Reflexibility. And in this respect the Science of colours becomes a Speculation as truly Mathematical as any other part of Optiques. 
<512r>
The third Part  Conclusions drawn from the foregoing Observations.
I am now come to another part of this designe which is to consider how the Phænomena of thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all other naturall bodies. Of these bodies I have already told you that they appeare of divers colours accordingly as they are disposed to reflect most copiously the rays originally indued with those colours. But their constitutions whereby they reflect some rays more copiously then others remaines to be discovered, & these I shall endeavour to manifest in the following Propositions.
Prop: 1. Those superficies of transparent bodies reflect the greatest quantity of light which have the greatest refracting power; that is, which intercede Mediums that differ most in their refractive densities: And in the confines of equally refracting Mediums there is no reflexion.
The Analogy between reflexion & refraction will appeare by considering that when light passeth obliquely out of one Medium into another which refracts from the Perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their refractive density the lesse obliquity is requisite to cause a totall reflexion. For as the sines are which measure the refraction, so is the sine of incidence at which the totall reflexion begins; to the Radius of the Circle, & consequently that incidence is least where there is the greatest difference of the sines. Thus in the passing of light out of water into Air where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 3 to 4 the totall reflexion begins when the angle of incidence is about 48degr 35min. In passing out of Glasse into Air where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31 the totall reflexion begins when the angle of incidence is 40degr 10min. And so in passing out of the Cristall or more strongly refracting Mediums into Air, there is still a lesse obliquity requisite to cause a totall reflexion. Superficies therefore which refract most do soonest reflect all the light, which is incident on them, & so must be allowed most strongly reflexive.
But the truth of this Proposition will further appeare by observing that in the superficies interceding two transparent Mediums (such as are Air, Water, , oyle Common Glasse, Crystall, Metalline Glasse Island glass, white transparent Arsnick, Diamonds &c,) the reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly as the superficies hath a greater or lesse refracting power. For in the confine of Air & common glass the reflexion is stronger then in the confine of air & water & still stronger in the confine of Air & Crystal & stronger in the confine of Air & a Diamond. If any of these & such like transparent solids be immerged in water or oyle or in spirit of wine or spirit of Turpentine its reflexion becomes much weaker then before, & still weaker if they be immer <512v> ged in the heavy liquor of well rectified oyle of Vitriol which differs less from them in density If water be distinguished into two parts by any imaginary surface; the reflexion in the confine of those two parts is none at all: in the confine of water & ice tis very little, in that of water & oyle tis something greater, in that of water & glass still greater & in that of water & crystal or other denser substances still greater, accordingly as those mediums differ more or less in density. Hence in the confine of common Glasse & Crystall there ought to be a weake reflexion & a stronger reflexion in the confine of common & Metalline Glasse tho I have not yet tried this: But in the confine of two Glasses of equall density, there is not any sensible reflexion as was shown in the 1st Observation. And the same may be understood of the superficies interceding two crystalls or liquors or any other substances in which no refraction is caused. So then the reason why uniforme pellucid Mediums (such as water glass or crystal) have no sensible reflexion but in their externall superficies where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one & the same degree of density.
Prop 2. The least parts of almost all naturall bodies are in some measure transparent. And the opacity of those bodies ariseth from the multitude of reflexions caused in their internall parts.
That this is so has been observed by others & will easily be granted by them that have been conversant with Microscopes. And it may also be tryed by applying any substance to a hole through which some light is immitted into a dark Room. For how opake soever that substance may seem in the open Air, it will by that meanes appeare very manifestly transparent if it be of a sufficient thinnesse. Only white Metalline Bodies must be excepted which by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the light incident on their first superficies, unless by solution in menstruums they be reduced into very small particles, & then they become transparent.
Prop: 3. Between the parts of opake or coloured bodies are many spaces, either empty or replenished with Mediums of other densities: as water between the tinging corpuscles wherewith any liquor is impregnated; Air between the aqueous globules that constitute Clouds or mists; & for the most part spaces voyd of both Air & Water but yet perhaps not wholy void of all substance. between the parts of hard bodies.
The truth of this is evinced by the two precedent Propositions For by the second Proposition there are many reflexions made by the internall parts of Bodies, which, by the 1st Proposition would not happen if the parts of those bodies were continued without any such interstices between them, because reflexions are caused onely in superficies which intercede Mediums of a differing density. by Prop 1 But further that this discontinuity of parts is the principall cause of the opacity of Bodies will appeare by considering that opake substances become transparent by filling their pores with any <513r> substance of equall or almost equall density with their parts. Thus Paper dipped in water or oyle, the Oculus Mundi stone steeped in water, Linnen cloth oyled or varnished, & many other substances soaked in such Liquors as will intimately pervade their little pores become by that meanes more transparent then otherwise. So on the contrary the most transparent substances may by evacuating their pores or separating their parts be rendered sufficiently opake, as salts or wet paper or the Oculus mundi stone by being dried, horn by being scraped, Glasse by being reduced to pouder or otherwise flawed, turpentine by being stirred about with water till they more imperfectly & water by being formed into many small bubbles either alone in the forme of froth, or by shaking it together either with Oyle of Turpentine or with some other convenient Liquor with which it will not perfectly incorporate. .
And To the increase of the opacity of these bodies it conduces something that by the 23rd Observation the reflexions of very thin transparent substances are considerably stronger then those made by the same substances of a greater thicknesse. [And to the reflexion of solid bodies it may further add, that the interstices of their parts are voyd of Air. For that for the most part they are so is reasonable to beleive considering the ineptitude which Air hath to pervade small cavities as appeares by the ascension of water in slender glasse pipes, paper, cloth & other such like substances whose pores are found too small to be replenished with Air, & yet large enough to admit water; & by the difficulty wherewith Air pervades the pores of a Bladder through which water finds ready passage. And according to the 11th Observation the cavities thus voyd of Air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflexion which those do that are replenished with it, but yet something more manifestly because the Medium in relation to refractions is rarest when most empty of Air as Mr Hook hath proved in his Micrographia. In which Book he hath also largely discoursed of this & the precedent Proposition, & delivered many other very excellent things concerning the colours of thin Plates & other naturall Bodies which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for my purpose.]
Prop: 4. The parts of bodies & their interstices must not be lesse then of some definite bignesse to render them opake & coloured.  For the opakest bodies of their parts be subtily divided (as Metall{s} by being dissolved in Acid Menstruums, &c) become perfectly transparent. And you may also remember that in the 8th Observation there was no sensible reflexion at the superficies of the Object-glasses where they were very neare one another though they did not absolutely touch. And in the 17th Observation the reflexion of the Water-bubble <513v> where it became thinnest, was almost insensible so as to cause very black spots to appear on the top of the bubble by the want of reflected light.
On these grounds I conceive it is that water, salte, glasse, stones & such like substances are transparent. For upon divers Considerations they seem to be as full of pores or interstices between their parts as other bodies are, but yet their parts & interstices to be too small to cause reflexions in their common surfaces.
Prop: 5. The transparent parts of bodies according to their severall sizes must reflect rays of one colour & transmit those of another, on the same grounds that thin Plates or Bubbles doe reflect or transmit those rays. And this I take to be the ground of all their colours.
For if a thind or plated Body which being of an eaven thicknesse appeares all over of one uniforme colour should be slit into threds or broken into fragments of the same thicknesse with the Plate. I see no reason why a heap of those threds or fragments should not constitute a masse or pouder of the same colour which the Plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all naturall bodies being like so –– many fragments of a Plate must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours.
Now that they doe so will appeare by the affinity of their Properties. As that the infusion of Lignum Nephriticum & many other substances reflect one colour & transmit another like thin bodies in the 19th & 20th Observations. That the colours of Silks, Cloths, & other substances which water or Oyle can intimately penetrate become more faint & obscure by being immerged in those liquors, & recover their vigor again by being dryed much after the manner declared of thin Bodies in the 10th & 21th Observations. And that some of those coloured pouders which Painters use may have their colours a little changed by being very elaborately & finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes besides the breaking of their parts into lesse parts by that contrition after the same manner that the colour of a thin Plate is changed by varying its thicknesse. For which reason also it is that the coloured Flowers of Plants & vegetables by being bruised usually become more transparent then before, or at least in some degree or other change their colours. Nor is it much lesse to my purpose that by mixing divers liquors very odd & remarqueable productions & changes of colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious & rationall then <514r> that the saline corpuscles of one liquor do variously act upon or unite with the tinging corpuscles of another, so as to make them swell or shrink (whereby not onely their bulk but their density also may be changed,) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, or make many of them associate into one cluster. For we see how apt those saline Menstruums are to penetrate & dissolve substances to which they are applyed & some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner if we consider the various Phænomema of the Atmosphære, we may observe that when vapors are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflexion in their superficies. But when in order to compose drops of rain they begin to coalesce & constitute globules of all intermediate sizes, those globules when they become of a convenient size to reflect some colours & transmit others, may constitute clouds of various colours according to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these colours besides the various sizes of its fluid & globular parcells, [which seem to affect a globular figure most; but yet perhaps not without some instability in the smallest of them by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any trembling motions in the Air.]
Prop: 6. The parts of Bodies on which their colours depend are denser then the Medium which pervades their interstices.
This will appeare by considering that the colour of a Body depends not onely on the rays which are incident perpendicularly on its parts, but on those also which are incident at all other angles. And that according to the 7th Observation a very little variation of obliquity will change the reflected colour where the thin body or small particle is rarer then the ambient Medium, insomuch that such a small particle will at diversly oblique incidences reflect all sorts of colours in so great a variety that the colour resulting from them all confusedly reflected from a heap of such particles must rather be a white or grey then any other colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect & dirty colour. Whereas if the thin Body or small particle be much denser then the ambient Medium, the colours according to the 19th Observation are so little changed of the variation of obliquity, that the rays which are reflected least obliquely may predominate over the rest so much as to cause a heap of such particles to appear very intensely of their colour. It conduces also something to the confirmation of this Proposition that according <514v> to the 22th Observation, the colours exhibited by the denser thin body within the rarer are more brisque then those exhibited by the rarer within the denser.
Prop: 7. The bignesse of the component parts of Naturall Bodies may be conjectured by their colours.
For since the parts of these bodies by Prop: 5 doe most probably exhibit the same colours with a Plate of equall thicknesse, provided they have the same refractive density; & since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with water or glasse, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect: to determin the sizes of those parts you need onely have recourse to the precedent Tables in which the thicknesse of Water or Glasse exhibiting any colour is expressed. Thus if it be desired to know the diameter of a corpuscle which being of equall density with glasse shall reflect Green of the third order; the number  shows it to be about  parts of an inch.
The greatest difficulty is here to know of what order the colour of any Body is. And for this end we must have recourse to the 4th & 18th Observations from whence may be collected these particulars
Scarlets & other Reds, Oranges & Yellows if they be pure & intense are most probably of the second Order. Those of the first & third order also may be pretty good, onely the yellow of the first order is faint & the Orange & Red of the third order have a great mixture of Violet & Blew.
There may be good Greens of the fourth order but the purest are of the third. And of this order the Green of all Vegetables seemes to be, partly by reason of the intensenesse of their colours, & partly because when they wither some of them turne to a greenish Yellow, & others to a more perfect Yellow or Orange or perhaps to Red, passing first through all the affore said intermediate colours. Which changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture which may leave the tinging corpuscles more dense, & something aumented by the accretion of the oyly & earthy part of that moisture. Now the Green without doubt is of the same order with those colours into which it changeth because the changes are graduall, & those colours though usually not very full yet are often too full & lively to be of the fourth order.
Blews & Purples may be either of the second or third order But the best are of the third. Thus the colour of violets seems to be of that order becaus their Syrup by acid liquors turnes red <515r> and by urinous & alcalizate turne green. For since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or attenuate, & of Alcalies to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the Syrup was of the second order, as acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would change it to a red of the first order, & an Alcaly by incrassating them would change it to a green of the second order; which red & Green, especially the Green, seem too imperfect to be the colours produced by these changes. But if the said purple be supposed of the third order, its change to red of the second & green of the third may without any inconvenience be allowed
If there be found any body of a deeper & lesse reddish purple then that of Violets its colour most probably is of the second order. But yet there being no body commonly known whose colour is constantly more deep then theirs, I have made use of their name to denote the deepest & least reddish Purples, such as manifestly transcent their colour in purity.
The Blew of the first Order though very faint & little may possibly be the colour of some substances. And particularly the Azure colour of the skys seems to be of this order. For all vapors when they begin to condense & coalesce into small parcells become first of that bignesse whereby such an Azure must be reflected before they can constitute clouds of other colours. And so this being the first colour which vapors begin to reflect, it ought to be the colour of the finest & most transparent Skys in which vapors are not arrived to that grosnesse requisite to reflect other colours as we find it is by experience.
Whitenesse if it be the most intense & luminous is that in the first order of colours. For of this sort I take the colour of white metals to be; or else it is a mixture of those succeeding the third or fourth order, such as is the colour of paper linnen, & most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes exhibiting the colours of the second & third order be mixed, they should rather constitute an imperfect whitenesse or Grey of which I have already spoken. But yet it seems not impossible for them to exhibit an intense whitenesse if they be disposed to transmit all the light which they reflect not, & do not retain & stifle much of it For thus I told you that Froth at a distance hath appeared very white & yet neare at hand the severall Bubbles of which it was constituted were seen tinged all over with rings of colours of the four or five first orders.
Lastly for the production of Black the corpuscles must be lesse then any of those which exhibit colours. For at all greater sizes there is too much light reflected to constitute this colour. But if they be <515v> supposed a little lesse then is requisite to reflect the white & very faint blew of the first order they will according to the 4th, 8th, 17th, & 18th Observations reflect so very little light as to appeare intensely black, & yet may perhaps varioully refract it to & fro with in themselves so long untill it happen to be stifled & lost, by which means they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transparency. And from hence may be understood why Fire & the more subtile dissolver Putrefaction turne substances to black; why small quantities of black substances impart their colour very freely & intensely to other substances to which they are applied; x why Glasse ground very elaborately with sand on a Copper plate till it be well polished makes the sand together with what is worne of from the glasse & Copper become very black; why black substances do soonest of all others become hot in the sun's light & burne, (which effect may proceed partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, & partly from the easy commotion of so very small corpuscles;) & why blacks are usually a little inclined to a blewish colour. For that they are so may be seen by illuminating white paper by light reflected from black substances, For the paper will usually appeare of a blewish white. And the reason is that Black borders on the obscure Blew of the first order described in the 18th Observation, & therefore reflects more rays of that colour then of any other.
In these descriptions I have been the more particular because it is not imposible but that Microscopes may at length be improved to the discovery of the particles of Bodies on which their colours depend if they are not already in some measure arrived to that degree of perfection. For if those Instruments are or can be so far improved as with sufficient distinctnesse to represent Objects five or six hundred times bigger then at a foot distance they appear to our naked eyes, I should hope that we might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles. And by one that would magnify thre or four thousand times perhaps they might all be discovered but those which produce blacknesse. In the meane while I see nothing materiall in this discourse that rationally may be doubted of excepting this Position, That transparent corpuscles of the same thicknesse & density with a Plate, do exhibit the same colour. And this I would have understood not without some latitude, as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular figures, & many rays must be obliquely incident on them, & so have a shorter way through them then the length of their diameters, as because the straitnesse of the Medium pent in on all sides which in such corpuscles may a little after its motions or other qualities on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last because I have observed of some small Plates of Moscovy-Glasse which were of an eaven thicknesse, that through a Microscope they have appeared of the same colour at their edges & corners where the included <516r> Medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it will add much to our satisfaction if those corpuscles can be discovered with Microscopes, which if we shall at length attain to I feare it will be the utmost improvement of this Sense. For it seems impossible to see the more secret & noble works of Nature within those corpuscles by reason of their transparency.
This may suffice concerning the constitution of naturall bodies on which their colours depend. But for further understanding the nature of reflexions I shall add these two following Propositions.
Prop: 8. The cause of Reflexion is not the impinging of Light on the solid or impervious parts of bodies, as is commonly beleived.
This will appear by the following Considerations. First that in the passage of light out of Glasse into Air there is a reflexion as strong as in its passage out of Air into Glasse or rather a little stronger & by many degrees stronger then in its passage out of Glass into Water. And it seems not probable that Air should have more reflecting parts then water of Glass. But if that should possibly be supposed yet it will availe nothing: for the reflexion is as strong or stronger when the Air is drawn away from the Glass, (suppose in the Air-Pump invented by Mr Boyle) as when it is adjacent to it. Secondly if light in its passage out of Glass into Air be incident more obliquely then at an angle of 40 or 41 degrees it is wholly reflected, if lesse obliquely it is in great measure transmitted. Now it is not to be imagined that light at one degree of obliquity should meet with pores enew in the Air to transmit the greater part of it, & at another degree of obliquity should meet with nothing but parts to reflect it wholly: especially considering that in its passage out of Air into Glass, how oblique soever be its incidence, it finds pores enew in the Glass to transmit the greatest part of it. If any man suppose that it is not reflected by the Air but by the outmost superficiall parts of the Glasse, there is still the same difficulty: besides that such a supposition is unintelligible, & will also appear to be false by applying water behind some part of the Glasse instead of Air. For so in a convenient obliquity of the rays suppose of 45 or 46 degrees at which they are all reflected where the Air is adjacent to the Glass, they shall be in great measure transmitted where the water is adjacent to it: which argues that their reflexion {illeg} or transmission depends on the constitution of the Air & water behind the glass & not on striking of the rays upon the parts of the glass. Thirdly if the colours made by a Prism placed at the entrance of a beam of light into a darkened Room be successively cast on a second Prism placed at a great distance from the former, in such manner that they are all alike incident upon it the second Prism may be so inclined <516v> to the incident rays that those which are of a blew colour shall be all reflected by it, & yet those of a red colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if the reflexion be caused by the parts of Air or Glass I would ask why at the same obliquity of incidence the Blew should wholly impinge on those parts so as to be all reflected, & yet the red find pores enew to be in great measure transmitted Fourthly where two Glasses touch one another there is no sensible reflexion as was declared in the 1st Observation; & yet I see no reason why the rays should not impinge on the parts of Glass when contiguous to another Glasse as much as when contiguous to Air. Fiftly when the top of a water-Bubble (in the 17th Observation) by the continuall subsiding & exhaleing of the water grew very thin there was such a little & almost insensible quantity of light reflected from it that it appeared intensely black, whereas round about that black spot where the water was thicker the reflexion was so strong as to make the water seem very white. Nor is it onely at the least thicknesse of thin Plates or Bubbles that there is no manifest reflexion but at many other thicknesses continually greater & greater. For in the 15th Observation the rays of the same colour were by turnes transmitted at one thicknesse & reflected at another thicknesse for an indeterminate number of successions. And yet in the superficies of the thinned Body where it is of any one thicknesse there are as many parts for the rays to impinge on, as where it is of any other thicknesse. Lastly if reflexion were caused by the parts of reflecting bodies it would be impossible for thin Plates or Bubbles at the same place to reflect the rays of one colour & transmit those of another as they do according to the 13 & 15 Observations. For it is not to be imagined that at one place the rays which for instance exhibit a blew colour should have the fortune to dash upon the parts & those which exhibit a Red to hit upon the pores of the Body; & then at another place where the body is either a little thicker or a little thinner, that on the contrary the Blew should hit upon its pores & the Red upon its parts. Lastly were the rays of light reflected by impinging on the solid parts of bodies, their reflexions from polished bodies could not be so regular as they are. For ✝
Prop. 9. Tis most probable that the rays which impinge on the solid parts of any body, are not reflected but shifted & lost in the body.
This is consentaneous to the precedent Proposition & will further appear by considering that if all the rays should be reflected which impinge on the internall parts of clear water or crystall, those substances should rather have a cloudy colour then so very clear <517r> transparency. And further there would be no Principle of the obscurity or blacknesse which some bodies have in all positions of the eye. For if all or almost all the light incident on those bodies did after many reflexions & refractions come out again it would make those bodies as lucid as other bodies are, & therefore to make them look black it is necessary that many rays be stopt retained & lost in them , & it seems not probable that any rays can be stopt & stifled in them which do not impinge on their parts
If you now ask how rays are reflected without impinging on the parts of a body, & how those which impinge on its parts may be stopped & stifled, it requires an Hypothesis to explaine it by. And so the manner how severall rays are unequally refrangible & reflexible, & originally indued with powers of striking the sense with several colours remaines to be explained Hypothetically: And the inventing of such an Hypothesis is no part of my designe I undertook only to discover the properties of light so far as I could derive them from experiments; & therefore content my self with having shewn those properties.

Draft of the 'Discourse Concerning Light and Colors'
[1] Obs: 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which were a little convex) might somewhere touch one another, I found the place in which they touched to become absolutely transparent as if they had there been one continued pei of glasse. For when the light fell so obliquely on the Air which in other places was between them, as to be all reflected yet in that place of contact it was wholly transmitted. Insomuch that when looked upon it appeared like a black or dark spot by reason that no light was reflected from thence as from other places; & when looked through it seemed, as it were, a hole in the Air that was formed into a thin plate by being compressed between the glasses, & through this hole objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly which could not at all bee seen through other parts of the glasses where the Air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex yet this transparent spot was of a considerable breadth, which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yeilding inwards of the parts of the glasses by reason of their mutuall pressure. For by pressing the glasses very hard together it would become much broader then otherwise.
Obs: 2. When the plate of Air by turning the Prisms about their common axis became so little inclined to the incident rays that some of them began to be transmitted, [& thereby to exhibit the blew Bow described in the second Experiment: as that Bow approached to the transparent spot] there arose in it many slender arcs of colours which at first were shaped almost like the Conchoid  as you see them here delineated. And by continuing the motion of the Prisms these arcs increased & bended more & more about the said transparent spot till they were completed into circles or rings incompassing it, & then they continually grew more & more contracted.
The parts of these circles at their first appearance [within the blew Bow] were of a vivid violet & blew, & between them were white arcs of circles which presently became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red & yellow, & to their outward limbs the blew was adjacent . So that the order of these colours from the centrall dark spot was at that time{,} White, Blew Violet; Darknesse; Red, Orange, Yellow, White, Blew, Violet; &c. But {the} yellow & Red were much fainter then the Blew & Violet. T
The motion of the Prisms about their axis being continued these colours contracted more & more shrinking towards the whitenesse on either side of it, & untill they totally vanished into it [so soon as the blew Bow was a little past them.] And then the circles in those parts appeared black and white without any other colours intermixed. But by further inclining the Prisms, the colours <519v> again emerged out of the whitenesse, the violet & blew at its inward limb & at its outward limb the red & yellow. So that now their order from the centrall spot was, white, yellow, red; black: violet, blew, white, yellow, red; &c contrary to what it was before.
Obs: 3. When the circles or some parts of them appeared onely black & white, they were very distinct & well defined, & the blacknesse seemed as intense as that of the centrall spot. Also in the vicine places, where the colours began to emerge out of the whitenesse they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered abobe thirty successions (recconing every black & white circle for one succession) & seene more of them which by reason of their smallnesse I could not number. But in other positions of the Prisms when the circles became coloured I could not distinguish above 8 or 10 of them, & the exteriour of those too were very confused & diluted.
In these two observations, to see the circles distinct, & without any other colour but black & white I found it very necessary that I held my eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye, yet there emerged a blewish colour out of the white which by dilating it selfe more & more into the black rendered the circles lesse distinct, & left the white a little tinged with red & yellow. I found also that by looking through a slit or oblong hole which was narrower then the pupill of my eye & held close to it parallel to the Prisms, I could see the circles much distincter, & freer from colours & visible to a far greater number then otherwise.
Obs. 4. To observe more nicely the orders of the colours which arose out of the white circles as the rays became lesse & lesse inclined to the plated Air; I layd the aforesaid Object Glasses one upon the other, & pressing them slowly together to make the colours successively emerge in the middle of the circles, where being of a considerable breadth, I could more easily discerne them, I found their succession & quantity to be as followeth.
Next to the pellucid ,centrall spot made by the contact of the glasses, succeded Violet, Blew, white, Yellow, & Red. The Violet & blew were so very little in quantity that I could not discerne them in the circles made by the Prisms, but the Yellow & Red were pretty copious & seemed about as much in extent as the white, & foure or five times more then the Blew & Violet. The next circuit of colours immediately incompassing these was Violet Blew, Green, Yellow, & Red. And these were all of them copious excepting the green which was very little in quantity & much more faint & dilute then the other colours. The third circuit was <520r> also Purple, Blew, Green, Yellow & Red; in which the Purple seemed a little more reddish then the Violet in the former circuit, & the Green was much more conspicuous, being as brisque & copious as any of the other colours except the yellow But the Red began to be a little faded inclining very much to purple. After these succeded a reddish Purple & with a little or no blew, & then followed Green which was very copious & far more lively then any other colour in this fourth circuit, but the Yellow & Red were very dilute, & the succeding colours became more & more diluted till after thre or four more revolutions they ended in perfect whitenesse.
Obs: 5. By measuring the diameters of the first six circles & squaring them I found their squares to be in Arithmeticall Progression. Namely the thicknesse at the middle of the limb of the first white circle being supposed one part, the thicknesse at the yellowish green in the second circle was three of those parts, & at the yellowish green in the third circle it was five of those parts, & so on. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint circles between the more lucid colours, & found their squares to be in arithmeticall progression of the eaven numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And it being very nice and difficult to take these measures exactly, I repeated them divers times at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same method I used in determining some others of the following Observations.
Obs: 6. The diameter of the sixt circle at its most lucid or yellow orbit was  parts of an inch, & consequently the thicknesse of the Air or Aereall intervall of the Glasses at that yellow circle was  of an inch, the eleventh part of which () is the thicknesse of their intervall at that part of the first circle where the yellow would be most vivid were it not mixed with other colours in the white. And this doubled gives the difference of their intervalls which are at the yellow in all the other circles viz , or to use a round number, the eighty thousanth part of an inch.
Obs: 7. These dimensions were taken when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses in or neare the axis of the circles, but when I viewed them obliquely they became bigger continually swelling as I removed my eye further from their axis. And partly by measuring the diameter of the same circle at severall obliquities of my eye, partly by other meanes, as also by making use of the two Prisms for very great obliquities; I found its diameter, & consequently the thicknesse of the plate of Air at its perimeter in all those obliquities to be very nearely in the proportions which I have expressed in this Table. 
<520v>

Obs 8. The dark spot also in the middle of the circles increased alittle by the obliquation of the eye, although almost insensibly. But between the Prisms its increase was more manifest when viewed so obliquely that no colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were incident most obliqeluy on the plated Air, & increased more & more untill the coloured circles appeared, & then decreased again but not so much as it increased before. And hence it is evident that that transparency was not onely at the absolute contact of the glasses, but also where they had some little intervall. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between half & two fift parts of the diameter of the exterior perimeter of the Red in the first circle when viewed almost perpendicularly; whereas when viewed obliquely it hath wholly vanished & become opake. Whence it may be collected that the glasses did then scarcely or not at all touch one another, & that their intervall at the perimeter of that spot when viewed perpendicularly was about a 5t or 6t part of their intervall at the perimeter of the said Red circle.
Obs 9. Wetting the Object glasses a little at their edges, the water crept in slowly between them, & the circles thereby became lesse & the colours more faint: In so much that as the water crept along one half of them at which it first arrived would appeare broken of from the other half & contracted into a lesse room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by air to be about seven to eight, & consequently the intervalls of the glasses at like circles caused by those two Mediums are about thre to four. Perhaps it may be a generall rule, that if any other Medium more or lesse dense then water be compressed between the glasses, their intervall at the circles caused thereby will be to their intervall caused by interjacent Air, as the sines are which measure the refraction made out of that Medium into Air.
Obs. 10. When the water was between the glasses if I pressed the upper glasse - variously at its edges to make the circles nimbly move from one place to another, a little bright spot would follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish. Its appearance was such as inter <521r> jacent Air would have caused, & it exhibited the same colours. But it was not Air, for where any aereal bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must rather have been caused by a subtiler Medium which could recede through the glasse at the creeping in of the water.
Obs: 11. Wetting plates of Muscovy glasse whose thinnesse made the like colours appeare, the colours became more faint especially by wetting the plate on that side opposite to the eye, but I could not perceive any variation in their species. So that the thicknesse of a plate requisite to produce any colour depends onely on the density of the plate & not of the ambient Medium. And hence by the 9th observation may be known the thicknesse of watry bubbles, or plates of muscovy glasse or of other substances which they have at any colour produced by them.
Obs: 12. A plated body which is denser then its ambient Medium, exhibits more brisque & vivid colours then that which ir rarer; as I have particularly observed in Glasse & Air. For blowing glasse very thin at a lamp Furnace, those plates incompassed with Air did exhibit colours much more vivid then those of Air plated between two glasses.
Obs: 13. By looking through the two contiguous object glasses without any water between them, I found that the interjacent Air exhibited coloured circles as well by transmitting light as by reflecting it. The centrall spot was white, & from it the order of the colours were Yellow, Red, Black; Violet, Blew, white, Yellow, Red; Violet, Blew, Green, Yellow, Red, &c. The first Yellow, & Red like the blew & violet in the 4th Obs were so little as scarcely to be discerned, & all the other colours were exceeding faint & dilute, unlesse when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses. For by that meanes they became pretty vivid. Comparing the coloured circles made by reflexion with these made by transmission of the light, I found that White was opposite to Black, Red to Blew, Yellow to Violet, & Green to a compound of Red & Violet. That is, those parts of the glasse were black when looked through which when looked upon appeared white, & on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited Blew, did in the other case exhibit Red. And the like of the other colours.
These observations were made in the open Air. But further to examin the effects of coloured light falling on the glasses, I darkened the Room, & viewing them by reflection of the colours of a Prism cast on a sheet of white paper I made the following observations.
Obs: 14. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to & fro <521v> about its axis that all its colours might successively fall on the same place of the paper & be reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles which the red light made, to be manifestly bigger then those which were made by the blew. And it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The intervall of the glasses at any of the Rings when they were made by the utmost red light, was to their intervall at the same Ring when made by the utmost Violet, greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 5 to 3. By the most of my observations it was as 9 to 14. And this proportion seemed the same in all obliquities of my eye, but in very great obliquities I have not yet observed it.
Obs 15. And that intervall of the glasses which was an arithmeticall mean between these two, the light was of a middle colour between green & yellow; & the extent of the red was almost double to that of the Violet: contrary to what happens in the colours made by the refraction of a Prism, where the Red is most contracted, the violet most expanded, & in the midst of them is the confine of green & blew.
Obs: 16. These Rings were not of various colours like those in the open air, but appeared all over of that Prismatick colour onely with which they were illuminated. And by projecting the Prismatick colours directly upon the glasses I found that the light which fell on the dark spaces between the coloured Rings, was transmitted through the glasses without any variation {.} For on a white paper it would paint Rings of the same colour with those which were reflected, & of the bignesse of their intermediate spaces. And from hence the origins of these Rings is manifest, namely that the aereall intervall of the glasses according to its various thicknesse, is disposed in some places to reflect & in others to transmit the light of any colour, & in the same place to reflect one colour where it transmits another.
Obs 17. The circles were here distincter & visible to a greater number then in the open Air. Obs: 18 And by making them all successively emerge in the middle, that I might more nicely compare the quantity of their light; the reflexion seemed to be something stronger from that circle which next incompassed the contact of the glasses, then from the exterior circles. And so in the open Air the whitenesse reflected from the first or inmost circles was stronger then the whitenesse or light reflected from the glasses at those parts which were without the circles, as I could very manifestly distinguish by viewing them at distance. And the same thing is observable of the outmost rings of the colours which appeare in thin plates of Muscovy-glasse in a contrary order, being caused by fissures or cavities within the glasse which are thinnest at their edges.
<522r>
Having given you my Observations on these colours it will not be difficult by some of them to unfold the causes of the others. To which end the 5t, 7th, 14th, 15th & 16th Observations doe principally conduce. And first to show how the colours in the 4th & 13 Observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line, the lengths QR Qa & Qh in proportion as 4, 9 & 14, & between Ra & Rh eleven meane proportionalls, of which let Rb be the 2d, Rc the 3d, Rd the 5t, Re the 7th, Rf the 9th & Rg the 10th. And at the points a, b, c, d &c erect perpendiculars aα, bβ, cγ, &c. by whose intervalls the extent of the severall colours set against them is to be represented. Then divide the line aα in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3;  5, 6, 7; 9, 10, 11; &c set at the points of division denote, & through those divisions from Q draw occult lines 1k, 2l, 3m; &c. crosse the perpendiculars, & let the intervalls between 1k & 3m, 5n & 7p &c be shaddowed faintly at the edges & more intensely towards the middle to represent there the strongest reflexion of each colour.
Now if a2 be supposed to represent the thicknesse of any plated body at which the deepest violet is most copiously reflected in the first ring or series of colours, then by the 14th Observation hl will represent its thicknesse at which the deepest or extreame Red is most copiously reflected in the same series. Also by the 5t & 14th Observations a6 & ho will denote the thicknesse at which those extreame colours are most copiously reflected in the second series, & so on. And the thicknesse at which any of the intermediate colours are reflected most copiously, will be defined by the intermediate parts of the lines 2l, 6O, &c; according to the 15th Observation
But further to define the latitude of these colours in each ring or series, let a1 designe the least thicknesse & a3 the greatest thicknesse at which the extreame purple in the first series is reflected, & let hk & hm designe the like limits for the extreame red, & the intermediate colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the lines 1k,& 3m. And in the second series let those limits be the lines 5n & 7p; and so on.
This being premised, to know what colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any thicknesse of a plated body, let a ruler be applyed parallel to ah, at that distance from it by which the thicknesse of the <522v> plate is represented: & the shaddowed spaces which it crosseth will denote the reflected originall colours of which the colour exhibited in the open Air is compounded. Thus if the constitution of the green in the third series of colours be desired; apply the Ruler as you see at XZ, & by its passing through some of the blew at X & yellow at Z, as well as through the green at Y, you may conclude that the green exhibited at that thicknesse of the plate, is principally constituted of originall green but not without a mixture of some blew & yellow.
By this meanes you may know how the colours from the center of the rings outwards ought to succeed in order as they were described in the 4th Observation. For if you move the Ruler gradually from ah through all distances, it will first arrive at 1 the violet, & then very quickly at the blew & green which together with that violet compound blew, & then at the yellow & red by whose further addition that blew is converted into whitenesse, which whitenesse almost continues during the transit from k to 3, & after that by the successive deficience of its component colours it turnes first to compound yellow & then to red, & last of all the red ceaseth at m. So that in this first series the colours on either side the white are compounded much after the same manner with those of the Prism explained in the 8th Experiment, but the violet & blew are here but very little in proportion to the red & yellow. Then begin the colours of the second series which succeed in order between 5 & p, & are more lively then before, because more expanded & severed. And for the same reason instead of the former white there intercedes between the blew & yellow a mixture of orang, yellow, green, blew, & some blewish violet, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute & imperfect green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in order, first the violet which a little interferes with the red of the second Order, & is thereby inclined to a reddish purple; then the blew & green which are lesse mixed with other colours & consequently more lively then before, especially the green; then follow the yellow & red which are mixed with the violet & blew of the 4th series, whereby various degrees of yellow, & Red inclining to purple are compounded, & the blew is much diminished being almost mixed with the former Red by the mixture of red. Then follows a pretty copious green which is the most eminent & conspicuous colour in that 4th series; & after that the severall series interfere more & more & their colours become more & more intermixed till after 3 or 4 more revolutions (in which the Red & Blew predominate by turnes) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended compound an eaven whitenesse.
And since by the 16th Observation one colour is transmitted where another is reflected, the reason of the colours made by the transmitted light in the 13th Observation is also hence evident.
But further to explain the Phænomena of the 2d & 3d Observations <523r> that is how the colours may (by turning the Prisms about their common axis the contrary way, to that expressed in those observations) be converted into white & black rings, and afterwards into colours again in an inverted order: it must be remembered that those colours are dilated by the obliquation of the rays to the plated Air, & that according to the table in the 7th observation, their dilatation or recession from their common center is most manifest & speedy when they are obliquest. Now the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first superficies of the Air which intercedes the Glasses then those of red, are thereby made more oblique to the second superficies at which they are reflected to produce these colours. And consequently the yellow in each ring will be more dilated then the red, & the excesse of its dilatation will be so much the greater by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rays. untill at last it become of equall extent with the red of the same ring. And for the same reason the green blew & violet will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rays as to become all very nearely of equall extent with the red, that is, equally distant from the center of the rings. And then all the colours of the same series must be coincident, & by their mixture exhibit a white ring. And these white Rings must have black or dark rings between them because they doe not spread & interfere with one another as before. And for that reason also they must be distincter & visible to far greater numbers. But yet the violet being obliquest will be something more dilated in proportion then the other colours, & so very apt to appeare at the exterior verges of the white.
Afterwards by a greater obliquity of the rays, the violet & blew become sensibly more dilated then the red & yellow, & so being further removed from the center of the rings, the colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the violet & blew at the exterior limbs of each Ring & the red & yellow at the interior. And the violet by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rays being in proportion most of all expanded, will soonest appeare at the exterior limb Ring , & become more conspicuous then the rest. And then the severall series of colours by their unfolding & spreading will begin again to interfere, & thereby render the rings lesse distinct & not visible to so great numbers.
There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered, & that is why the black & white Rings which when viewed at distance appeare distinct, should not onely become confused by viewing them neare at hand, but also yeild a violet colour at both the edges of every white Ring. And the reason is that the rays which {let}the eye at severall parts of the pupill, have severall obliquities {illeg} {the} <523v> Air which is between the Glasses, & those which are the most oblique, if considered apart would represent the circles bigger then those which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the perimeter of every Ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays & inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of obliquity, that is, by how much the pupill is wider, or the eye nearer to the glasses. And the breadth of the violet must be most expanded because the rays apt to excite a sensation of that colour are most oblique to the further superficies of the plated Air at which they are reflected, & have also there the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. Also as the breadth of each circle is thus augmented, the dark intervalls must be diminished untill the neighbouring rings become continuous & are blended, the exterior first, & then those nearer the center, so that they can no longer be distinguished apart, but seem to constitute an eaven & uniforme whitenesse.
These are the principall Phænomena of thin Plates or Bubbles whose explications depend on the properties of light that I have heretofore delivered, & these you see do necessarily follow from them, & punctually agree with them even to their very least circumstances; & not onely so, but very much tend to their proof. For considering the multitude of rings & other circumstances in the 3d & 17th Observations nothing can be more evident then that although in the 4th Observation there appeare no more then 8 or 9 rings of colours yet there are really a far greater number which so much interfere & mingle as after those 8 or 9 revolutions to dilute one another wholly & constitute an eaven & sensibly uniform whitenesse. And consequently that whitenesse must be allowed a mixture of all colours.
To make this more fully appeare I shall tell you another very odd experiment which these considerations not long since suggested to me, & upon tryall succeded somthing beyond my first expectations. And it is that when the two Object-glasses, as in the said 4th Observation were layd one upon the other so as to make the coloured rings appeare, though with my naked eye I could not discerne above 8 or 9 of those rings yet by viewing them through a Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch that I could number more then fourty besides many others that were so very small & close together that I could not keep my eye so steddy, on them severally as to number them. But by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more then a hundred, & I beleive the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, though visible onely so far as they can be separated by the refraction. <524r> I have sometimes so layed one Object-glasse on the other that to the naked eye they have all over seemed uniformely white without the least appearance of any of the coloured rings, & yet by viewing them through a Prism great multitudes of those rings have discovered themselves. And in like manner plates of Muscovy-glasse & bubbles of water & of glasse blown at a lamp furnace which were not so thin as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up & down the plate in the forme of waves. From whence it deserves to be considered that out of light or whitenesse in appearance uniform, & without any termination with shaddow or darknesse colours may be made to emerge by viewing it through a Prism. And that the refractions of a Prism which render almost all things confused that to the naked eye appeare distinct should make these rings appeare exceedingly distinct which to the naked eye are so confused & blended together as not at all to be discernable apart. By the first consideration the whitenesse must be allowed a heterogeneall mixture or confusion of those coloured circles which emerge. By the second it is manifest that the refractions of each ray considered apart are regularly performed without spreading or dissipating it into any diverging parts. For admitting such an irregularity it would be impossible for refractions to render those circles so very distinct & well defined. And from both the said considerations it follows that the rays of severall colours made as well by plated bodies as by the refractions of Prisms have severall degrees of refrangibility whereby those of each order which at their reflexion are intermixed with those of other orders, are separated from them by refraction, & associated together so as to become visible by themselves
But before I further give you the reason of these Phænomena tis convenient that I describe their circumstances more particularly, the principall of which are these. That it was but one side of the rings made by the two Object glasses, namely that towards the angle of the Prism comprehended by the refracting planes, which by the refraction was rendered distinct, & the other side became more confused then to the naked eye, in so much that there, I could not discerne above one or two & sometimes none of those rings of which I could discerne 8 or 9 with my naked eye. Also the order of the colours neare the center on that side towards the distinct arcs was usually inverted. And if the refraction was too great the middle part of those arcs became confused so as to constitute in appearance an uniforme whitenesse, whilst on either hand the ends of those arcs, as also the whole arcs furthest from the center became distintc{test} <524v> And the arcs where they appeared distinctest, were onely white & black successively without any other colours intermixed. So that if I first held the Prism very neare the object glasses & then gradually removed it further of towards my eye, the colours of the 2d, 3d, & 4th rings &c shrunk towards the white that emerged between them untill they wholly vanished into it at the middle of the arcs & afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. to that at the ends.
Having told you these circumstances the reason of them you will perceive by supposing the concentrick circles AD & BC to represent the red &  violet of any order or revolution of the colours. For these being viewed through a Prism the violet circle BC will by a greater refraction be further translated from its place then the red AD, & so approach nearer to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance if the red be translated to ad, the violet may be translated to bc so as to approach nearer to it at c then before & if the red be further translated to ad, the violet may be so much further translated to bc as to convene with it at c, & if the red be further translated to αδ, the violet may be still so much further translated to βγ as to passe beyond it at γ & convene with it at e & f. And this being understood not onely of the red & violet but of all the other intermediate colours & also of every revolution of those colours, you will easily perceive how those of the same revolution or order by their nearnesse at cd & δγ, & their coincidence at cd, e & f ought to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles (especially at cd o{illeg} at e & f) & that they will appeare severally at cd, at cd exhibit whitenesse by their coincidence, & again appeare severally at δγ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before & still retain beyond e & f. But on the other side at ab, ab, or αβ these colours must become much more confused by being dilated & spread so as to interfere with those of other orders. And the same confusion will happen at δγ between e & f if the refraction be very great, or the Prism very distant from the object-glasses, in which case no parts of the ring will bee seen save onely two little arcs at e & f, whose distance from one another will be augmented by removing the Prism still further from the object glasses. And these must be distinctest & whitest at their middle, & at their ends where they begin to grow confused they must be coloured. And the colours at one end of every arc must be in a contrary order to those at the other end, by reason that they crosse in the intermediate white. Namely their ends which verge towards δγ will be red & yellow on that side <525r> next the center, & blew & violet on the other side, But their other ends which verge from δγ will be on the contrary be blew & violet on that side towards the center, & on the other side red & yellow.
For confirmation of all this I need allege no more then that it is mathematically demonstrable from my former Principles. But yet I shall add that they which please to take the paines may by the testimony of their senses be assured that these explications are not Hypotheticall but infallibly true & genuine . For in a dark Room by viewing these rings through a Prism by reflexion of the severall Prismatick colours which an Assistant causes to move to & fro upon a wall or paper from whence they are reflected, whilst the spectators eye, the Prism, & the object-glasses (as in the 14th Observation) are placed steddy: the position of the circles made by the severall colours successively, will be found such in respect of one another as I have described at abcd, or abcd, or αβδγ. ✝
Concerning small fragments of glasse plates there is this further observable, that if they lying flat upon a table be turned about their centers, whilst they are viewed through a Prism; the most of them will in all positions exhibit waves, & that for the most part appearing almost all over the glasse, [& parallel or almost parallel to the length of the Prism]. ✝ The reason is that the superficies of such plates are not eaven but have many cavities & swellings which how shallow soever do a little vary the thicknesse of the plate . And by the severall sides of those cavities there must be produced waves in severall postures of the Prism. Now though it may be but some very small & narrow parts of the glasse whereby these waves for the most part are caused yet they may seem to extend themselves over the whole glasse, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of severall orders confusedly reflected which by refraction of the prism are unfolded & dispersed to severall places so as to constitute so many severall waves as there were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the glasse.
[2] I come now to the last part of this designe, which is to consider how the Phænomena of thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all other naturall bodies, the usuall objects of our senses; ✱ that we may be in some measure enabled to understand what constitutions are requisite in those bodies to make them appeare of various colours. And this I shall endeavour in the following propositions.
1. That the small parts of all naturall bodies (those of metalls perhaps & some other ponderous minerall substances which are of a mercuriall originall being excepted) are transparent. And to this they that have been conversant with Microscopes will easily assent.
2. That between the parts of coloured or opake bodies are many intervalls replenished with Mediums of other densities; as water between the tinging corpuscles wherewith any liquor is impregnated, Air between the {illeg} globules that constitute clouds or mists most part spaces voyd of both Air & water but yet perhaps replenished with some subtiler Medium between the parts of naturall bodies And this also will easily be {illeg} by them that have contemplated bodies by the assistance of a Microscope or <525v> by chemicall examinations observed their heterogeneous constitution or taken notise how they may be pervaded by Menstruums, & Metalls by Quicksilver. But yet for further assureance you may remember that according to the 1st Observation there is no reflexion made in the superficies of homogeneall parts of pellucid bodies where they are contiguous; but if they be of different densities there will be a reflexion proportionall to that difference. As may be tryed in glasse which reflects lesse when contiguous to water then when to Air, & still lesse when contiguous to spirit of wine or oyle of vitrioll. So that to render bodies very opake tis either requisite that their density differ very much from the density of the adjacent Medium, Or that multitudes of reflecting superficies succede one another, the latter of which may interrupt the rays which passe through the former. From the first of these causes may arise the opacity of Quicksilver which seems to reflect all the light incident on its outmost superficies; & from the last must be derived the opacity of bodies which are not so dense as to have their least parts opake. And that this is a sufficient cause you will easily apprehend by considering that the most transparent substances may by separating their parts be rendered sufficiently opake, as water by being formed into many small bubbles, or glasse by being reduced to powder or otherwise flawed And that by the 18th Observation the reflexions of very thin transparent substances are considerably stronger then those made by the same substances of a greater thicknesse. And also by the 12th Observation that the colours of a denser substance incompassed with a rarer are more strong & lively then those of a rarer substance incompassed with a denser. To which I may add that if something conduces to the reflexion of solid bodies that the interstices of their parts are voyd of Air. For that for the most part they are so is reasonable to beleive, considering the ineptitude which Air hath to pervade small cavities, as appeares by the ascention of water in glasse pipes, paper, cloth & other such like substances whose pores are found too small to be replenished with Air & yet large enough to admit water; & by the difficulty wherewith Air pervades the pores of a bladder through which water finds ready passage. And according to the 10th Observation, the cavities thus voyd of Air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflexion which those do that are replenished with it, but yet something more manifestly because the Medium in relation to refractions is rarest when most empty of Air as Mr Hook hath proved in his Micrographia. In which book he hath also largely discoursed of these two Propositions, & delivered many other very excellent things concerning the colours of plated & other naturall bodies, which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for my purpose.
3. The parts of bodies & their interstices must not be lesse then of some definite bignesse to render them opake or coloured. F the opakest bodies if their parts be very subtily divided (as metalls by being dissolved in acid Menstruums &c) become perfectly transparent. And you may also remember that in the 8th Observation there was no reflexion at the superficies of the Object-glasses where they were very neare one another though they did not absolutely touch. On these grounds also I <526r> conceive it is that water, salts, glasse; stones & such like substances are transparent. For upon divers considerations they seem to be as porous as other bodies, but yet their pores too small to cause any opacity.
4. The transparent parts of bodies according to their severall sizes must reflect rays of one colour & transmit those of another, on the same grounds that plated bodies doe reflect or transmit those rays. And this I take to be the ground of all their colours. For if a plated body which being of an eaven thicknesse appeares all over of one uniform colour; should be broken into fragments of the same thicknesse with the plate; I see no reason why a heap of those fragments should not constitute a pouder of the same colour which the plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all naturall bodies being like soe many fragments of a plated body, must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours. Now that they doe so will further appeare by the affinity of their properties. As that the infusion of Nephritic Wood & many other substances reflect one colour & transmit another, like plated bodies in the 13 Observation That the colours of silks, cloaths, & other substances which water or oyle can intimately penetrate, become more faint & obscure by being immerged in those liquors & recover their vigor again by being dryed, much after the manner declared of plated bodies in the 9th & 11th Observations. And That some of those coloured pouders which Painters use may have their colours a little changed by being very elaborately & finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes besides the breaking of their parts into lesse parts by that contrition, after the same manner that the colour of a plate is changed by varying its thicknesse. For which reason also it is that many flowers by being brused become more transparent then before or at least in some degree or other change their colours. Nor is it much lesse to my purpose that by mixing divers liquors, very odd & remarqueable productions & changes of colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious & naturall then that the saline corpuscles of one liquor doe variously act upon or unite with the tinging corpuscles of another liquor so as to make them swell or shrink, (whereby not onely their bulk but their density also may be changed) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, or make many of them associate into one cluster. For we see how apt those saline Menstruums are to penetrate & dissolve substances to which they are applyed & some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner if we consider the various Phænomena of the Atmosphære, we may observe that when vapors are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflexion in their superficies. But when in order to compare drops of rain they begin to coalesce & constitute globules of all intermediate sizes; those globules when they become of a convenient size to reflect some colours & transmit others, may constitute clouds of colours according to their sizes. And indeed I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these colours besides the various sizes of its parcells, which seem to affect a globular figure most, but yet not without some instability in the smallest {of them} by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any {illeg} <526v> in the Air.
5. By meanes of the 4th, 5t, 6t, 9th & 11th Observations, we may be inabled in some measure to guesse at the bignesse of the parts of a body by its colour, provided that those parts must be of the same thicknesse with a plated body of equall density to exhibit the same colour. And to this end I have in the following table expressed the thicknesse of plated Air, Water, & Glasse requisite to produce the severall colours of each order. The method which I used to determine it was by moving a streight Ruler over the precedent scheme parallel to the line ah, as I told you. In which scheme suppose st, tv, vw &c to represent the difference of the thicknesses of plated Air exhibiting the severall orders of yellow that is  of an inch according to the 6t Observation; & rs will be half that difference or . Which being known, the thicknesse requisite to exhibit any other colour is easily determined by that scheme.
And since by the 9th Observation the thicknesse of plated Air is to that of plated water exhibiting the same colour, as 4 to 3, & to that of plated glasse as 31 to 20; the thicknesse of those plated Mediums at which they represent any colour will on the same grounds be also determined. And these thicknesses at which each colour is most intense & specific in the foure first orders, I have in the following Table expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand parts.

Now since the parts of naturall bodies are supposed to exhibit the same colours with a plated body of equall thicknesse, provided they have the same refractive density; & since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with water or glasse, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect: you need onely have recourse to the tables for water or glasse to determin the sizes of these parts. Thus if it be desired to know the diameter of a corpuscle which being of equall density with glasse, shall reflect green of the third order; the number  shows it to be about  parts of an inch. 
It is not impossible but that the sizes of the pores of bodies may sometimes conduce to the production of their colour. And for that reason I have added a table for plated Air whose refractive density is not considerally <527r> different from that of spaces voyd of Air such as I suppose to be the pores of bodies. But yet these pores seem to be of such irregular sizes that I cannot understand how they should all conspire to reflect any one colour much more then another
By the way I cannot but observe another use to be made of this Table which is to determin what colour must be produced by laying two or more plated bodies upon one another so as to compose one plate equalling them all in thicknesse. For instance Mr Hook observes that a faint yellow plate of Muscovy Glasse layd upon a blew one constituted a very deep purple. Now the yellow of the first order is a faint one, & the thicknesse of the plate exhibiting it according to the Table is 5, to which add 10 the thicknesse exhibiting blew of the second order & the summ will be  which most nearely approaches 16 the thicknesse exhibiting the purple of the third order.
But to apply these Tables more particularly to the determining the sizes of the parts of bodies by their colours tis convenient that I now consider to what order the intensest colours are most usually to be referred, which will be easily done by meanes of the fourth Observation as it is explained by the afforesaid Scheme.
And first for Scarlet & other Reds oranges & Yellows, if they be pure & intense they are most probably of the second order. Those of the 1 & 3 order also may be pretty good, onely the Red of the 3d order hath too great a mixture of Blew & Violet.
There may be very good Greens of the 4th order but the purest are of the third. And of this order I conceive the green of all Vegetables to be, partly from the intensenesse of their colours & partly because when they wither some of them turne to a greenish yellow, others to more perfect yellow or Orange, or perhaps to Red passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate colours. changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture which leaves the tinging corpuscles more dense, & something augmented by the accretion of the oyly & earthy part of that moisture. Now the Green without doubt is of the same order with those colours into which it changeth because the changes are graduall, & those colours though usually not very pure yet for the most part are too pure & lively to be of the fourth order.
As for Blews & Purples they may be either of the second or third order. But the best are of the third. Thus the colour of Violets seems to be of that order, because their {Syrup} by acid liquors turne red & by urinous or alcalizate turne green Now since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or alternate & of Alcalies to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the Syrup was of the second order, an acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would change it to a red of the first order, & an Alcaly by incrassating them would change it to a green of the second order, which red & green especially the Green seem too imperfect to <527v> be the colours produced by these changes. But if the said purple be supposed of the third order, its change to red of the 2d & green of the third order may without any inconvenience be allowed.
Whitenesse if it be intense is either that in the first order of colours, (of which sort perhaps is the colour of white Lead,) or else it is a mixture of those succeding the 3r or 4th order, such as is the colour of paper, ffroth, linnen, & most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes exhibiting the colours of the second & third order be mixed they should rather to constitute an imperfect whitenesse or Grey of which I have already spoken. But yet it seemes not impossible for them to exhibit an intense whitenesse if they be disposed to transmit all the light which they reflect not, & do not retain & stifle some of it. For thus I told you that froth at a distance hath appeared very white & yet neare at hand the severall bubbles of which it was constituted. were seen all over tinged with Rings of colours. of the four or five first orders
Lastly for the production of Black the corpuscles must be lesse then any of those which exhibit colours, because at all greater sizes there is too much light reflected to constitute this colour. But if they be supposed a litle lesse then is requisite to reflect the Blew of the first order they will according to the 8th Observation reflect so very little light as to appeare intensely black by which meanes they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transparency & yet may perhaps variously refract it to & fro within themselves so long untill it happen to be stifled & lost. And this seemes to be confirmed by these considerations that Glasse ground very elaborately with sand n a Copper plate till it be well polished makes the sand together with what is worne of from the glasse & Copper become very black. That Fire & the more subtile dissolver Putrefaction turne substances to black. And that black substances do the soonest of all others become hot & burne, which effect may procede partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, & partly from the easy commotion of so very small corpuscles. To which I may add this further consideration that blacks are usually a little inclined to a blewish colour as may be manifestly seen by illuminating white paper by reflexion from black substances, for the paper will usually appeare of a blewish white. And this ought to happen because black bordering on the obscure blew of the first Order, described in the Observation the larger corpuscles of black substances will reflect that colour.
In the {thus} description of these colours & their origine I have been the more particular I have been the more particular because I hope that Microscopes will at length be improved to the discovery of their colorific corpuscles. For if those instruments can be so far improved as with sufficient distinctnesse to represent objects five or six hundred times bigger then at a foot distance they appeare to the naked eyes, I should hope that wee might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles. And by one that would magnify two or thre thousand times perhaps they might all be discovered but those which produce blacknesse. In the meane while I see not any thing materiall that can rationally be doubted of excepting this Position, {That transparent} <528r> corpuscles of the same thicknesse & density with a plated body doe exhibit the same colour. And this I would have understood not without some latitude as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular figures, & many rays must be obliquely incident & so have a shorter way through them then the length of their diameter, as because the straitnesse of the Medium pent in on all sides may a little alter its motions or other qualities on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last because I have observed of some small plates of Moscovy glasse which were of an eaven thicknesse, that through a Microscope they have appeared of the same colour at their edges & corners where the included Medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it will add much to our satisfaction if these corpuscles can be discovered with Microscopes, which if we shall at length attain to, I feare it will be the utmost improvement of this Sence. For it seemes impossible to see the more secret & noble workes of nature within those corpuscles by reason of their transparency.
[3] If it were now my designe to conjecture at the causes of these Properties which I have ascribed to light, & show whence its rays may have their different dispositions to excite in us the sensation of severall colours, & accordingly differ in refrangibility, & also in their reflectibility from plated bodies of severall thicknesses or corpuscles of severall sizes: it would be necessary for me to pitch upon some Hypothesis. And I find none that so well answers all things as that which Mr Hook hath chosen for me; namely that Light is corporeall & consists of multitudes of very little bodies emitted every way from shining substances. Now these I should suppose to be of different sizes & velocities & accordingly to suffer different refractions in the passing out of one Medium into another; as we may observe that stones being thrown into water, the swiftest are least diverted from their course. Bur further as Air is observed to be of its own accord the thinnest in the smallest cavities, so I should suppose Æther to be thinnest in the densest bodies whose pores I take to be the smallest; & thence it might easily be explicated why refractions made into the denser Medium, are towards the perpendicular, & that in a certain proportion of the sines 
As to reflexions I should suppose them to be caused by the rigidnesse of the superficies of Æther such as is found in the superficies of all other fluids. Now when the irradiated corpuscles impinge on these superficies, they must excite an undulation in the Æther, something after the manner that stones thrown into water cause an undulation in its superficies. And in their passage through plated bodies if they arrive at the further superficies at the same time with the compressed <528v> & condensed part of the vibrations excited at the first superficies they are reflected, but if they arrive there with the relaxed & rarefied part they are transmitted. For the rigidnesse of the reflecting superficies must be increased or diminished accordingly as the Æther is comprest or relaxed; not to mention that the contrary motions on contrary sides of the wave may very much conduce to this effect. This I conceive will suffice to explicate how it may depend on the thicknesse of a plate or corpuscle whither light shall be reflected or transmitted, & how light may be reflected at one thicknesse & transmitted at another to an indefinite number of successions. And if it be further supposed that the rays which cause a violet & blew colour excite shorter vibrations in the Æther then those which cause red & yellow, it will also appeare why the first should be reflected at a lesse thicknesse of a Plate then the last.
But further when light is incident on the bottom of the eye it must excite the same vibrations in the Æther which pervades the Retina that it doth in that of all other transparent substances. And those vibrations being propagated in order through the severall fibers of the Optick nreve into the Brain may there affect the soule with a sensation of various colours according to their various proportions, something after the manner that various sounds are produced by various proportions of the vibrations of the Air. The harmony and discord also which the more skilfull Painters observe in colours may perhaps be effected & explicated by various proportions of the æthereall vibrations as those of sounds are by the aëreall. To which end I would suppose the vibrations causing the deepest scarlet to be those causing the deepest violet as two to one; for there would be all that variety in colours which within the compasse of an eight is found in sounds, & the reason why the extreames of colours Purple & scarlet resemble one another would be the same that causes Octaves (the extreames of sounds) to have in some measure the nature of unisons.
I should further suppose that when an irradiated corpuscle of light in passing through a body chanceth to impinge on any of its parts, it will not be reflected but stick fast till by the dissolution of that body, or some new commotion it be again set at liberty. And by this meanes it is that many bodies appeare obscure or black, namely those which refract or reflect light so long to & fro within themselves till it happen to dash against their parts. And to give you an account why they then stick fast, you may consider how Air excluded from between two polished marbles or plates of glasse causeth them strongly to adhhere by compressing them together on the out side. So Æther may cause the suspension of Quicksilver in the Torricellian experiment at a much greater height then 29 inches; for it ought to croud the parts of such bodies together since it is supposed to be more dense & springy without then within them. And this seemes to be the principall cause of the cohesion of the parts of all naturall bodies, composing them for the most part first into those very small clusters which I have hitherto called corpuscles, & then aggregating those clusters into greater {illeg}. And much after the same manner it is that when a corpuscle of light <529r> To these I added two other Rules, whereof one was to know the proportion of the sines measuring the refractions of homogeneall rays made out of one Medium into another, by knowing the proportion of the sines measuring the refractions of those rays made out of Air or any third Medium into those two. And the other was to know the difference of the refractions of heterogeneall rays alike incident out of any Medium into any other Medium, by knowing the difference of their refraction out of glasse into Air
The first Rule is, that as the ratio of the given sines of incidence to the ratio of the given sines of refraction, so are the desired sines of incidence & refraction to one another. For instance if the sine of incidence be to the sine of refraction out of Air into water as 4 to 3, & out of Air into Glasse as 31 to 20 to know the refractions out of water into glasse, I say as  the ratio of the given sines of incidence to  the ratio of the given sines of refraction, that is as 93 to 80, so is the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction made out of water into glasse.
The other Rule is, that if refractions be made out of divers Mediums into one common Medium with equall incidence, the differences between the common sine of incidence & the sines of the refractions of difform rays shall have a given ratio. Suppose for instance the common sine of incidence out of glasse into Air be 44, & the sine of refraction for the utmost purple 69, for the utmost red 68, & for the meane between blew & green (the rays which have a middle degree of refrangibility) 68. So shall their difference be 24 23 & 24. Suppose further that the sine of incidence out of water into air for the said meane rays between blew & green be to the sine of refraction as 3 to 4. Then say as 1 the difference of these sines to 3 the sine of incidence, so 24 the difference of the other correspondent sines, to a fourth number 72, which instead of 3 suppose to be the common sine of incidence out of water into Air, & to it adding 24, 23, & 24, you have 97, 96, & 97 the sines of refraction of the afforesaid rays, namely 97 of the utmost purple 96 of the utmost red & 97 of the rays exhibiting a middle colour between blew & green.
In like manner to know the refractions of difform rays made out of water into Glasse, suppose their common sine of incidence out of Air into Glasse be 106, & the sines of refraction of the extreame purple 68 of the extreme red 69, & of the middle rays exhibiting a colour between blew & green 68. Which sines subduct from the sine of incidence, & there remains 38, 37, & 37. Suppose also that the sine of incidence out of water into glasse for the said middle rays is to the sine of refraction as 93 to 80 & say as 13 the difference of these sines to 93 the sine of incidence so 37 the difference of the other correspondent sines to a fourth number 264, which being put the common sine of incidence if you subtract from it 38, 37, & 37, the remainders 226, 227, & 227 will be the sines of refraction out of water into glasse for the afforesaid difform rays.

Draft of the 'Discourse concerning Light and Colors'
SR
I suppose you understand that all transparent substances (as Glasse, water, Air &c) when made very thinne by being blown into bubbles or otherwise formed into plates, doe exhibite various colours according to their various thinnesse, although at a greater thicknesse they appear very clear & colourlesse. In my former discourse about the constitution of light, I omitted those colours, because they seemed of a more difficult consideration, & were not necessary for stablishment of the Doctrine which I propounded. But because they may conduce to further discoveries for completing that Theory, especially as to the constitution of the parts of naturall bodies on which their colours or transparency depend, I have now sent you an account of them. To render this discourse short & distinct, I have first described the principall of my observations & then considered & made use of them. The Observations are these.
Obs: 1. Compressing two Prisms hard together that their sides (which by chance were a very little convex) might somwhere touch one another, I found the place in which they touched to become *[1] absolutely transparent, as if they had been there one continued peice of Glasse. for when the light fell so obliquely on the Air, which in other places was between them, as to be all reflected; in that place of contact it seemed wholy transmitted: in so much that when looked upon it apeared like a black or dark spot by reason that no sensible light was reflected from thence as from other places; & when looked through it seemed as it were, a hole in that Air that was formed into a thinner plate by being compressed between that glasses. And through this hole objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly which could not at all be seen through other parts of the Glasses, where the Air was interjacent. Although the glasses were a little convex yet this transparent spot was {illeg} considerable breadth, which breadth seemed principally {illeg} proceed from the yeilding inwards of the parts of the glasses {illeg} {reason} of their mutual pressure. For by pressing them {illeg} hard together it would become much broader then other. <549v> Obs: 2. When the plate of Air, by turning the Prisms about their common Axis became so little inclined to the incident rays, that some of them began to be transmitted; there arose in it many slender Arcs of coloures which at  first were shaped almost like the conchoid as you see them here delineated. And by continuing the motion of the Prisms, those Arcs increased & b{e}nded more & more about the said transparent spot, till they were completed into circles or rings incompassing it, & afterwards continually grew more & more contracted.
These Arcs at their first appearance were of a violet & blew colour, & between them were white Arcs of circles which presently became a little tinged in their inward limbs with red & yellow, & to their outward limbs the blew was adjacent. So that the order of those colours from the Centrall dark spot, was at that time white, Blew, Violet; Black; Red, Orang, yellow, White Blew, Violet, &c. But the yellow & Red were much fainter then the Blew & Violet.
The motion of the Prisms about their Axis being continued those colours contracted more & more, shrinking towards the whitenesse on either side of it, untill they totally vanished into it. And then the circles in those parts appeared black & white without any other colours intermixed. But by further moving the Prisms about, the colours again emerged out of the whitenesse, the Violet & blew at its inward limb, & at its outward limb the red & yellow. So that now their order from the centrall spot was white, Yellow, Red, Black, Violet, Blew white, yellow, Red, &c. contrary to what it was before.
Obs: 3. When the rings {at} some parts of them appeared only black & white, they were very distinct & wel-defined & the blacknesse seemed as intense as that of the Centrall Spot. Also in the Borders of these rings where the colours began to emerge out of the whitenesse, they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty successions (recconing every black & white ring for one succession) & seen more of them which by reason of their smalnesse I could not number. But in other Positions of the Prisms at which the {illeg} appeared of many colours, I could not distinguish above {illeg} of them, & the exteriour of those too were {illeg} {illeg} dilute.
In these two Observations to see the ring {illeg} any other colour but black & white, I found {illeg} <550r> that I held my eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my eye, yet there {illeg}ged a blewish colour out of the white, which by dilating it selfe more & more into the black rendered the circles lesse distinct & left the white a little tinged with red & yellow. I found also that by looking through a slit or oblong hole which was narrower then the pupill of my eye & held close to it paralell to the Prisms, I could see the circles much distincter & visible to a far greater number then otherwise.
Obs: 4. To observe more nicely the order of the colours which arose out of the white circles as the rays became lesse & lesse inclined to the plate of Air; I took two Objectglasses the one a plano-convex for a fourteen foot Telescope, & the other a large double convex for one of fifty foot, & upon this laying the other with its plane side downwards, I pressed them slowly together to make the colours successively emerge in the middle of the Circles & then slowly lifted the upper glasse from the lower to make them successively vanish again in the same place, where being of a considerable bredth, I could more easily discern them. And by this meanes I observed their succession & quantity to be as followeth.
Next to the pellucid centrall pot made by the contact of the glasses succeeded Violet, Blew, White, Yellow, & Red. The Violet & blew were soe very little in quantity that I could not discerne them in the circles made by the Prisms, but the yellow & Red were pretty copious, & seemed about as much in extent as the white, & 4 or 5 times more then the blew & Violet. The next circuit or order of colours imediately incompassing these was Violet, Blew, Green, yellow, & Red. And these were all of them copious & vivid excepting the green which was very little in quantity & seemed much more faint & dilute then the other colours. Of the other four the Violet was least & the blew lesse then the yellow or Red. The third circuit or order was also Purple, Blew, Green, yellow, & Red, in which the Purple seemed more redish then the Violet in the former circuit, & the green was much more conspicuous, being as brisq3 & copious as any of the other colours except the yellow, but the Red began to be a little faded inclining very much to purple. After these succeded {Green} & Red. The Green was very copious & lively inclining on the {illeg} side to blew & the other to yellow. But in this 4th circuit {illeg} was neither Violet, blew, nor yellow & the red was very imperfect & dirty. Also the succeeding colours became more & more imperfect & dilute after three or four more <550v> Revolutions they ended in perfect whitenesse.
Obs: 5. To determine the intervall of the glasses, or thicknesse of the interjacent Air by which each colour was produced, I measured the diameters of the first six rings at the most lucid part of their Orbits & squaring them I found their Squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11. And since one of the glasses was plane & the other Sphericall their intervalls at those rings must be of the same progression. I measured also the diameters of the dark or faint rings between the more lucid colours & found their squares to be in Arithmeticall progression of the eaven numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. And it being very nice & difficult to take those measures exactly I repeated them diverse times at divers parts of the glasses, that by their agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same Method I used in determining some others of the following observations.
Obs: 6. The diameter of the first ring at the most lucid part of its orbit was  parts of an inch & the diameter of the Sphere on which the double convex object glasse was ground was 102 foot, as I found by measuring it; & consequently the thicknesse of the Air, or Aereall intervall of the glasses at that ring was  of an inch. For as the diameter of the said sphere (102 foot or 1224 inches) is to the semi diameter of the ring  so very nearly is that semi diameter to  the said distance of the glasses. Now by the precedent observation the eleventh part of this distance () is the thicknesse of the Air at that part of the first ring where the yellow would be most vivid were it not mixed with other colours in the white, & this doubled gives the difference of its thicknesses at the yellow in all the other rings. viz  or to use a round number the eighty thousandth part of an inch.
Obs: 7. Those dimensions were taken when my eye was placed perpendicularly over the glasses in or near the Axis of the Rings, but when I viewed them -->obliq3ly they became bigger continually swelling as I removed my eye further from their Axis. And partly by measuring the diameter of the same Circle at severall obliquities of my eye, partly {illeg} as also by making use of the two Prisms for{illeg} {illeg}tios, I found its diameter, & consequently the thicknesse {illeg} at its Perimeter in all those obliquities to be {illeg} Proportions expressed in this Table.

In the two first Columns are expressed the obliquities of the rayes to the Plate of Air, that is their angles of inciden{illeg} & refraction. In the third Column the diameter, of any coloured Ring in those obliquities, is exprest in parts of which ten constitute that diameter when the rayes are perpendicular. And in the fourth Column the thicknesse of the Air at the Circumference of that Ring is exprest in parts of which also 10 constitute that thicknesse when the rayes are perpendicular.
Obs. 8. The dark Spot in the middle of the Rings increased also by the obliquation of the eye although almost in sensibly But if in stead of the Object-glasses the Prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest when viewed soe obliquely that no colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent Air & increased more & more untill the coloured rings appeared, & then decreased again but not soe much as it increased before. And hence {it} is evident that the transparency was not only at the absolute contac{illeg} of the glasses but also where they had some little intervall. I have sometimes observed the diameter of that spot to be between halfe & two fift parts of the diameter of the exterior circumference of the Red in the first circuit or revolution of colours when viewed almost perpendicularly, wheras when viewed obliq3ly it hath wholy vanish'd & become opake & white like the other parts of the glasse. Whence it may be collected that the glasse did then scarcely or not at all touch one another, & that their intervall at the perimeter of that Spot when viewed perpendi{cu}larly was about a 5{illeg}th or 6th part of their intervall at the circumference of the said Red.
Obs: 9. By looking through the two contiguous )bject-glasses, I {illeg}the interjacent Air exhibited Rings of colours as well {illeg} by reflecting it. <551v> The centrall Spot was now white, & from it the order of the colours were yellowish Red, Black, Violet, Blew, white, yellow, Red; Violet Blew, Green, yellow, Red &c. But these colours were very faint & dilute unlesse when the light was trajected very obliquely through the glasses, For by that means they became pretty vivid. Onely the first yellowish-Red, like the blew in the 4th Observation was soe little & faint as scearcely, to be discerned: comparing the coloured Rings made by reflexion, with those made by transmission of the light I found that white was opposite to black, Red to blew, yellow to Violet & green to a compound of Red & Violet. That is, those parts of the glasse were black when looked through, which when looked upon appeared white & on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited blew, did in the other case exhibit Red. And the like of the other colours.
Obs: 10. Wetting the object-glasses a little at their edges the water crept in slowly between them & the circles thereby became lesse & the colours more faint: in so much that as the water crept along, one halfe of them at which it first arrived would appear broken off from the other halfe & contracted into a lesse Room. By measuring them I found the proportion of their diameters to the diameters of the like circles made by Air to be about seven to eight, & consequently the intervalls or the glasses at like circles caused by those two mediums water & Air are as about three to four. Perhaps it may be a generall Rule that if any other medium more or lesse dense then water be compressed between the glasses, their intervall at the Rings caused thereby will be to their intervall caused by interjacent Air, as the sines are which measure the refraction made out of that Medium into Air.
Obs: 11. When the water was between the glasses If I pressed the upper glasse variously at its edges to make the Rings move nimbly from one place to another, a little bright Spot would immediately follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish; Its appearance was such as interjacent Air would have caused & it exhibited the same colours. But it was not Air for where any aereall bubbles were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must rather have been caused by a {illeg} which could recede through the glasse at {illeg} Water
Obs: 12 These observations were made in {illeg}ther to examine the effects of coloured light {illeg} {illeg} darkned the Room & viewed them by reflex{ein} {illeg} cast on a sheet of white paper. And by this {illeg} {illeg} & visible to a {far} another number {illeg} <552r> I have sometimes seen more then 20 of them, wheras in the open Air I could not discerne above 8 or 9.
Obs: 13. Appointing an Assistant to move the Prism to & from about its Axis, that all its colours might successively fall on the same place of the paper & be reflected from the circles to my eye whilst I held it immoveable; I found the circles which the red light made to be manifestly bigger then those which were made by the Blew & Violet. And it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the colour of the light was changed. The intervall of the Glasses at any of the Rings when they were made by the utmost red light was to their intervall at the same Ring when made by the utmost Violet, greater then 3 to 2 & lesse then 13 to 8. By the most of my Observations it was as 9 to 14. And this proportion seemed very nearly the same in all obliquities of my eye; unlesse when two Prisms were made use of instead of the Object-glasses. For then at a certain great obliquity the Rings made by the severall colours seemed equall, & at a greater obliquity those made by the Violet would be greater then the same Rings made by the Red.
Obs: 14. While the Prism was turned about uniformly, The contraction or dilatation of a Ring made by all the severall colours of the Prism successively reflected from the Object glasses, was swiftest in the Red, slowest in the Violet & in intermediate colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. comparing the extent which each colour obteined by this contraction or dilatation I found that the blew was sensibly more extended then the Violet, the yellow then the Blew, & the Red then the yellow. And to make a juster estimation of their proportions I observed that the extent of the Red was almost double to that of the Violet, & that the light was of a middle colour between yellow & Green at that intervall of the Glasses, which was an Arithmeticall mean between the two extreames: contrary to what happens in the colours made by the refraction of a Prism, where the Red is most contracted, the Violet most expanded, & in the midst of them is the confine of Green & Blew.
Obs: 15. These Rings were not of various colours like those in the open Air but appeared all over of that Prismatiq3 colours only with which they were illuminated. And by projecting the Prismatiq3 colours immediately upon the glasses I found that the light {illeg} fell on the dark Spaces which were between the coloured Rings {illeg} as transmitted through the Glasses without any variation of colou{illeg} {illeg} on a white paper placed behind, it would paint Rings of the {illeg} colour with those which were reflected & of the bignesse. <552v> And from hence the origine of those Rings is manifest, namely that the Aereall intervall of the glasses, according to its various thicknesse, is disposed in some places, to reflect, & in others to transmitt the light of any colour, & in the same place to reflect one colour where it transmitts another.
Obs: 16. The squares of the diameters of these Rings made by any Prismatiq3 colour were in Arithmeticall progression as in the 5t Observation. And the diameter of the 6t circle when made by the yellow & viewed almost perpendicularly was about  parts of an inch, agreeable to the 6t Observation.
The precedent Observations were made with a rarer thin Medium terminated by a denser, such as was Air or water compressed betwixt two Glasses. In those that follow are set down the appearances of a denser medium thin'd within a rarer, such as are plates of Moscovy-glasse, Bubbles of water, & some other thin substances terminated on all sides with Air.
Obs: 17. If a Bubble be blown with water, first made tenacious by dissolving a little soap in it tis a common observation that after a while it will appear tinged with a great variety of colours. To defend these Bubbles from being agitated by the externall Air (wherby their colours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no acurate observation can be made of them,) as soon as I had blown any of them I covered it with a clear glasse, & by that means its colours emerged in a very regular order like soe many concentrick Rings incompassing the top of the Bubbles And as the Bubble grew thinner by the continuall subsiding of the water these Rings dilated slowly & overspread the whole Bubble descending in order to the bottom of it where they vanished successively. In the mean while after all the colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the center of the Rings a small round black Spot, like that in the first observation, which continually dilated it selfe till it became sometimes more then  or  of an inch in breadth before the Bubble broak. At first I thought there had been noe light reflected from the water in that place, but observing it more curiously I saw within it severall smaller round spots which appeared much blacker & darker then the rest, whereby I know that there was some reflection at the other places which were not soe dark as those Spots. And by further tryall I found that I could see the images of {illeg} of a candle or the Sun) very faintly reflected {illeg} great black spot but also from the little {illeg} within it.
Besides the aforesaid coloured Rings {illeg} {illeg} pear small Spots of colours ascending {illeg} {illeg} the sides of the Bubble {illeg} <553r> subsiding of the water. And sometimes small black Spots generated at the sides would ascend up to the larger black Spot at the top of the Bubble & unite with it.
Obs: 18. Because the colours of these Bubbles were more extended & lively then those of Air thin'd between two Glasses, & so more easie to be distinguished. I shall now give you a further description of their order as they were observed in viewing them by reflexion of the skies when of a white colour whilst a black substance was placed behind the Bubble. And they were these; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Blew; Red, Green; Red, yellow, Green, Blew, Purple; Red, yellow Green, Blew, Violet; Red, yellow, white, Blew, Black.
The three first successions of Red & Blew were very dilute & dirty, specially the first where the Red seemed in a manner to be white; Amongst those there was scarcely any other colour sensible, onely the Blewes (& principally the second,) inclined a little to Green.
The fourth Red was also dilute & dirty but not so much as the former three; after that succeeded little or no yellow, but a copious green which at first was inclined a little to yellow, & then became a pretty brisq3 and good willow Green, & afterwards changed to a blewish colour; but there succeeded neither Blew nor Violet.
The fift Red at first was very much inclined to purple & afterwards became more bright & brisk but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with a very bright & intense yellow, which was but little in quantity, & soon changed to Green: But that Green was copious & something more pure, deep & lively then the former Green. After that followed an excellent Blew, of a bright sky colour, & then a purple which was lesse in quantity then the Blew & much inclined to Red.
The sixt Red was at first of a very fair & lively scarlet, & soon after of a brighter colour being very pure & brisk & the best of all the Reds. Then after a lively Orange followed an intense bright & copious yellow, which was also the best of all the yellows; & this changed first to a greenish yellow, &then to a greenish Blew; But the green between the yellow & blew was very little & dilute, seeming rather a greenish white then a green. The blew which succeeded became very {illeg} & of a fair bright sky colour, but yet something {inferior} to the former Blew, And the Violet was intense & {illeg} which little or no rednesse in it, And lesse in quantity {illeg} the Blew.
<553v>
In the last Red appeared a tincture of Scarlet next the Violet, which soon changed to a brighter colour inclining to an Orange; And the yellow which followed was at first pretty good & lively, but afterwards it grew more & more dilute untill by degrees it ended in perfect whitenesse. And this whitenesse if the water was very tenacious & well tempered; would slowly Spread & dilate it selfe over the greatest part of the Bubble, continually growing paler at the top, where at length it would crack in many places, & those cracks as they dilated would appear of a pretty good, but yet obscure & dark sky colour; the white between the blew Spots diminishing untill it resembled the threds of an irregular nett-work & soon after vanished & left all the upper part of the Bubble of the said dark blew colour. And this colour after the aforesaid manner dilated it selfe downwards untill sometimes it hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the mean while at the top which was of a darker Blew then the bottom & appeared also of many round blew Spots something darker then the rest, there would emerge one or more very black Spots & within those other Spots of an intenser blacknesse, which I mentioned in the former observation And these continually dilated them selves untill the Bubble broak.
If the water was not very tenacious the Black spots would break forth in the white without any sensible intervention of the blew: And sometimes they would break forth within the precedent yellow, or Red, or perhaps within the Blew of the second order before the intermediate colours had time to display themselves.
By this description you may perceive how great an affinity these colours have with those of Air described in the 4th Observation although set down in a contrary order by reason that they begin to appear when the Bubble is thickest, & are most conveniently reckoned from the lowest & thickest part of the Bubble upwards.
Obs: 19. Viewing at severall oblique positions of my eye the Rings of colours emerging on the top of the Bubble; I found that they were sensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity but yet not so much by far as those made by thin'd Air in the 7th Observation. For there they distended {illeg} viewed most obliq3ly to arrive at a part {illeg} {illeg}12 times thicker then that where they {illeg} {illeg} perpendicularly, whereas in this case the {illeg} at which they arriv'd when viewed most obliq3ly {illeg} which exhibited them by perpendicular Rayes {illeg} {illeg} <554r> By the best of my Observations it was between 15 and 15 to 10; an increase about 24 times lesse then in the other case.
Sometimes the Bubble would become of an uniform thicknesse all over except at the top of it near the black Spot; as I knew because it would exhibit the same appearance of colours in all positions of the eye: And then the colours which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays would be different from those that were seen in other places by rayes lesse oblique to it. And divers spectators might see the same part of it of differing colours by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now observing how much the colours at the same place of the Bubble or at divers places of equall thicknesse were varied by the severall obliquities of the rayes; by assistance of the 4th, 14th, 16th & 18th observations as they are hereafter explained, I collected the thicknesse of the water requisite to exhibit any one the same colour as severall obliquities to be very nearly in the proportion expressed in this Table.

In the two first columns are expressed the obliquities of the rayes to the superficies of the water, that is their angles of incidence & refraction. Where I suppose that the sines which measure them are in round numbers as three to four, though probably the dissolution of soape in the water may a little alter its refractive Virtue. In the third column the thicknesses of the Bubble at which any one colours is exhibited in those severall obliquities, is exprest in parts of which {ten} constitute that thicknesse when the rays are perpendicular.
I have sometimes observed of the colours which arise on polished steel by heating it, or on Bell-metall & some other me{illeg} substances when melted & poured on the ground where {illeg} {cool} in the open Air, that they have like those of <554v> water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers obliquities, & particularly that a deep Blew or Violet when viewed very obliq3ly hath been changed to a deep Red. But the Changes of these colours are not so sensible as of those made by water For the coria or vitrified part of the metall which most metalls when heated or melted continually protrude to their surface where by covering them in form of a thin glassy skin it causes these colours, is much denser then water; and I find that the change made by the obliquation of the eye is least in colours of the densest thin substances.
Obs: 20. As in the 9th Observation so here the Bubble by transmitted light appeared of a contrary colour to that which it exhibited by reflexion. Thus when the Bubble being looked on by the light of the clouds reflected from it, seemed Red at its apparent circumference, if the clouds at the same time or very suddenly were viewed through it, the colour at its circumference would be blew. And on the contrary when by reflected light it appeared blew, it would appear Red by transmitted light.
Obs: 21. By wetting Plates of Muscovy-glasse whose thinnesse made the like colours appear, the colours became more faint, especially by wetting the Plates on that side opposite to the eye; but I could not perceive any variation of their Species. So that the thicknesse of a Plate requisite to produce any colour depends only on the density of the Plate & not of the ambient medium. And hence by the 10th & 16th observations may be known the thicknesse of Bubbles of water or Plates of Moscovy-glasse, or of any other substances which they have at any colour produced by them.
Obs: 22. A thin transparent body which is denser then its ambient medium, exhibits more brisk & vivid colours then that which is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in Air & Glasse. For blowing glasse very thin at a lamp furnace, those Plates encompassed with Air did exhibit colours much more vivid then those of Air made thin between two glasses.
Obs: 23. Comparing the quantity of light reflected from the severall Rings, I found it was most copious from the first or inmost, & in the exterior Rings became gradually lesse & lesse. Also the whitenesse of the first {Ring was}stronger then that reflected from those parts of the {illeg} were without the Rings; as I could manifest{illeg} {illeg} at distance the Rings made by the two {colours} {illeg} comparing two Bubbles of water blown {illeg} the first of which the whitenesse appeared {illeg} lours, & the whitenesse which preceded {illeg}
<555r>
Obs: 24. When the two object glasses were layd upon one another so as to make the Ringes of colours appear, though with my naked eye I could not discern above 8 or 9 of those Ringes yet by viewing them through a Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, in so much that I could number more then fourty, besides many others that were so very small & close together that I could not keep my eye so steddy on them severally as to number them. But by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more then a hundred. And I beleive the experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, though visible onely so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter explain.
But it was but one side of the Rings, namely that towards which the refraction was made , which by that refraction was rendered distinct, & the other side became more confused then to the naked eye, In so much that there I could not discerne above one or two, & sometimes none of those Rings, of which I could discern 8 or 9 with my naked eye. And their segments or arcs which on the other side appeared so numerous, for the most part exceeded not the third part of a circle. If the refraction was very great or the Prisms very distant from the Object-glasses, the middle part of those arcs became also confused so as to disappear & constitute an even whitenenesse, whilst on either side their ends, as also the whole arcs furthest from the center became distincter  then before, appearing in the form you see them here designed.
The arcs where they seemed distinctest were only white & black successively without any other colours intermixed. But in other places there appeared colours whose order was inverted by the refraction in such manner that if I first held the Prism very near the Object glasses & then gradually removed it farther of towards my eye, the colours of the 2d, 3d, 4th & following Rings shrunk towards the white that emerged between them untill they wholy vanished into it at the middle of the Arcs, & afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. But at the ends of the arcs they retained their order unchanged.
I have sometimes so layd one Object-glasse upon the other that to the naked eye they have all over seemed uniformly white without the least appearance of any of the coloured Rings; & yet by viewing them through a Prism great multitudes of those Rings have <555v> Discovered themselves. And in like manner Plates of Moscovy-glasse & bubbles of glasse blown at a lamp-furnace which were not soe thin as to exhibit any colours to the naked eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up & down in the form of Waves. And so bubbles of water before they began to exhibit their colours to the naked eye of a by stander have appeared through a Prism, girded about with many parallell & horizontal Rings: to produce which effect, it was necessary to hold the Prism parallel or very nearly parallel to the Horizon, & to dispose it so that the rayes might be refracted upwards.
Having given my Observations of these colours before I make use of them to unfold the causes of the colours of naturall bodies, it is convenient that by the simplest of them, I first explain the more compounded, such as are the 2d, 3d, 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 20th, & 24th.
And first to show how the colours in the 4th & 18th Observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line the lengths YZ, YA, & YH in proportion as  4, 9, & 14 & between ZA & ZH eleven mean proportionalls, of which let ZB be the second, ZC the third, ZD the fift, ZE the seventh, ZF the ninth, & ZG the tenth. And at the points A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, let perpendiculars Aα, Bβ, &c. be erected, by whose intervalls, the extent of the severall colours set underneath against them, is to be represented. Then divide the line Aα in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3; 5, 6, 7; 9, 10, 11; &c. set at the point of division denote. And through those divisions from Y draw lines 1J, 2K, 3L; 5M, 6N, 7O; &c
Now if A2 be supposed to represent the thicknesse of any thin transparent body at which the utmost violet is most copiously reflected in the first Ring or series of colours, then by the 13th Observa{illeg} {illeg} sent its thicknesse at which the utmost Red {illeg} <556r> in the same series. Also by the 5t & 16th Observations {illeg} HN will denote the thicknesses at which those extream colours are most copiously reflected in the second series, & so on. And the thicknesse at which any of the intermediate colours are reflected most copiously will according to the 14th Observation, be defined by the intermediate parts of the lines 2K, 6N, &c against which the names of those colours are written below.
But further to define the latitude of these colours in each Ring or series let A1 design the least thicknesse & A3 the greatest thicknesse at which the extream Violet in the first series is reflected, & let HJ & HL design the like limits for the extream Red, & the intermediate colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the lines 1J & 3L; against which the names of those colours are written. And in the second series let those limits of the lines 5M & 7O; & so on: But yet with this caution that the reflexions be supposed strongest at the intermediate spaces 2K, 6N, 10R &c & to decrease gradually towards these limits 1J,3L; 5M, 7O; &c on either side, where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited but to decay indefinitely. And wheras I have assigned the same latitude to every series, I did it because although the colours in the first series seem to be a little broader then the rest by reason of a stronger reflexion there, yet that inequality is so insensible as scarcely to be determined by observation.
Now according to this Description conceiving that the rays in that severall colours in here are by turnes reflected at the spaces 1J, L3, 5MO7, 9PR11, &c; & transmitted at the Spaces AHJ1, 3LM5, 7OP9 &c; it is easie to know what colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any thicknesse of a transparent thin Body. For if a Ruler be applyed parallel to AH, at that distance from it by which the thicknesse of the Body is represented, the alternate spaces 1JL3, 5MO7 &c. which it crosseth will denote the reflected originall colours of which the colour exhibited in the open Air is compounded: Thus if the constitution of the Green in the third series of colours be desired; apply the Ruler as you see at π, ρ σ, φ, And by its passing through some of{f} the Blew at π, & yellow at σ, as well as through the green ρ, you may conclude that green exhibited at that thicknesse of the body is principally constituted of originall green, but not without a mixture of some blew & yellow.
By this meanes you may know how the colours from the water of the Rings outwards ought to succeed in order as they were described in the fourth & 18th observations. <556v> For if you move the Ruler gradually from AH through all distances, having past over the first space which denotes little or no reflexion to be made by thinnest substances, it will first arrive at the Violet & then very quickly at the Blew & green which together with that Violet compound Blew, & then at the yellow & Red by whose further addition that Blew is converted into whitenesse, which whitenesse continues during the transit from J to 3, & after that by the successive deficience of its component colours turnes first to compound yellow & then to Red, & last of all the Red ceaseth at L. Then begin the colours of the second series, which succeed in order between 5 & O, & are more lively then before because more expanded & severed And for the same reason instead of the former white {there} intercedes between the blew & yellow a mixture of Orange, Yellow, Green, Blew & Indico, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute & imperfect Green. So the colours of the third series all succeed in order; first the Violet which a little interferes with the Red of the second order & is thereby inclined to a reddish Purple; then the blew & green which are lesse mixed with other colours & consequently more lively then before; especially the Green: Then followes the yellow some of which towards the Green is distinct & good, but that part of it towards the succeeding Red, as also that Red is mixed with the Violet & Blew of the fourth series whereby various degrees of Red very much inclining to Purple are compounded. The Violet & Blew which should succeed this Red being mixed with & hidden in it, there succeeds a Green, And this at first is much inclined to blew, but soon becomes a good Green, the only unmixt & lively colour in this fourth series. For as it verges towards the yellow it begins to interfere with the colours of the fift series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow & Red are very much diluted & made dirty, especially the yellow which being the weaker colour is scarce able to show it selfe. After this the severall series interfere more & more & their colours become more & more intermixed till after three or four more revolutions (in which the Red & blew predominate by turnes) all sorts of colours are in all places pretty equally blended & compound one eaven whitenesse.
And since by the 15th Observation the rayes indued with one colour are transmitted where those of another clolour {illeg} reason of the colours made by the transmitted {illeg} {illeg} Observations is also from hence evident.
If not only the order & Species of {these} {illeg} the precise thicknesse of the Plate of thin{illeg} {illeg} are exhibited, be defined in parts of an {illeg} performed by performed by assistance of the 6t or 6th {illeg} <557r> For according to those observations the thicknesse of the thin Air which between two glasses exhibited the Orange as bright red of the 6th order was  parts of an inch. Now suppose this thicknesse to be represented by Gτ & the eleventh part of it Gλ as will be about  of an inch. And so Gμ, Gν, Gζ, Gο, will be , , , & . And this being known it is easie to determine what thicknesse of Air is represented by Gφ or any other distance of the Ruler from AH.
But further since by the 10th observation the thicknesse of Air was to the thicknesse of water which between the same glasses exhibited the same colour, as 4 to 3; & by the 21th observation the colours of thin Bodies are not varied by varying the ambient Medium; the thicknesse of a Bubble of water exhibiting any colour will be  of the thicknesse of Air producing the same colour. And so according to the same 10th &. 21th Observations the thicknesse of a Plate of glasse whose refraction is measured by the proportion of the sines 31 to 20 may be  of the thicknesse of Air producing the same colours. And the like of other Mediums. On these grounds I have composed the following Table wherin the thicknesse of Air, water, & glasse at which each colour is most intense & specific, is expressed in parts of an inch divided into ten hundred thousand equall parts.

Now if this Table be compared with the third Scheme you will there see the constitution of each colour as to its ingredients or the originall colours of which it is compounded, & thence be enabled to judge of its intensenesse or imperfection; which may suffice in explication of the fourth & 18th Observations unlesse it be further desired to delineate the manner how the colours appear when the two Object-glasses are layd upon one another. To doe which let there be described a large Arc of a Circle, & a streight line which may touch that Arc, & parallel to that Tangent severall occult lines at such distances from it as the numbers set against the severall colours in the Table denote. For the Arc & its Tangent will represent the superficies of the glasses terminating the interjacent Air, & the places where the occult lines cut the Arc will show at what distances from the center or point of contact each colour is reflected.
There are also other uses of this Table: For by its assistance the thicknesse of the Bubble in the 19th Observation was determined by the colours which it exhibited. And so the bignesse of the parts of naturall bodies may be conjectured at by their colours, as shall be hereafter shown. Also if two or more very thin Plates be layd one upon another so as to compose one Plate equalling them all in thicknesse, the resulting colour may be hereby determined. For instance, Mr Hook in his Micrographia observes that a faint yellow plate of Moscovy glasse layd upon a blew one constituted a very deep purple. The yellow of the first order is a faint one, & the thicknesse of the plate exhibiting it according to the Table, is 5 to which add 9 {the thicknesse} exhibiting Blew of the second order, & the summe {illeg} nearly approaching 14 the thicknesse {illeg} {illeg} the third order.
To explain in the next place the {illeg} 2d & 3d Observations, that is, how these colours {illeg} Prisms about their common Axis the {illeg} <558r> that expressed in those Observations) may be converted into white & black Rings, & afterwards into colours again in an inverted order: it must be remembred that those colours are dilated by the obliquation of the rayes to the Air which intercedes the Glasses, & that according to the Table in the 7th Observation their dilatation or recession from their common center is most manifest & speedy when they are obliquest. Now the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first superficies at the said Air then those of Red, are therby made more obliq3 to the second superficies at which they are reflected to produce the coloured Rings, & consequently the yellow in each Ring will be more dilated then the Red; & the excesse of its dilatation will be so much the greater by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rayes, untill at last it become of equall extent with the Red of the same Ring. And for the same reason the Green, blew & Violet will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rayes as to become all very nearly of equall extent with the Red, that is, equally distant from the center of the Rings. And then all the colours of the same series must be coincident, & by their mixture exhibit a White Ring. And these White Rings must have black or dark Rings between them because they doe not spread & interfere with one another as before. And for that reason also they must become distincter & visible to far greater numbers. But yet the Violet being obliquest will be something more dilated in proportion then the other colours, & so very apt to appear at the exterior verges of the white.
Afterwards by a greater obliquity of the rays, the Violet & Blew become sensibly more dilated then the Red & Yellow, & so being further removed from the center of the Rings, the colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the Violet & Blew at the exterior limbs, & the Red & yellow at the interior. And the Violet by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rayes being in proportion most of all expanded will soonest appear at the exterior limb of each White Ring & become more conspicuous then the rest. And the severall series of colours by their unfolding & spreading will begin again to interfere, & thereby render the Rings lesse distinct & not visible to soe great numbers.
If instead of the Prisms the objectglasses be made use of the Rings which they exhibit become not white & distinct {by the} obliquity of the eye, by reason that the rayes in their <558v> Passage through that Air which interceded the glasses are very nearly parallel to themselves when first incident on the glasses, & consequently those indued with severall colours are not inclined one more then another to that Air as it happens in the Prisms.
There is yet another circumstance of these experiments to be considered, & that is why the black & white Rings which when viewed at distance appear distinct, should not only becom confused by viewing them near at hand, but also yeild a Violet colour at both the edges of every white Ring. And the reason is that the rayes which enter the eye at severall parts of the Pupill have severall obliquities to the glasses, & those which are most obliq3, if considered apart, would represent the Rings bigger then those which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the Perimeter of every white Ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays & inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of the obliquity that is, by how much the Pupill is wider, or the eye nearer to the Glasses. And the breadth of the Violet must be most expanded, because the rayes apt to excite a sensation of that colour are most oblique to the second or further superficies of the thin'd Air at which they are reflected, & have also the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. And as the breadth of every Ring is thus augmented, the dark intervalls must be diminished, untill the neighbouring Rings become continuous, & are blended, the exterior first, & then those nearer the center, so that they can no longer be distinguished apart but seem to constitute an eaven & uniform whitenesse.
Amongst all the Observations theire is none accompanied with so odd circumstances as the 24th. Of those the Principall are that in thin Plates which to the naked eye seem of an eaven & uniform transparent whitenesse the refraction of a Prism should make the Rings of colours appear; wheras it usually makes Objects appear coloured onely where they are terminated with shadows, or have parts unequally luminous, & that it should make those Rings exceedingly distinct & white although it usually renders objects confused & coloured. The cause of these things you will understand, by considering that all the Rings of colours are really in the Plate when viewed with the {illeg} although by reason of the great breadth of {illeg} {illeg}rency they so much interfere & are blended {illeg} they seem to constitute an eaven whitenesse {illeg} rayes passe through the Prism to the eye {illeg} severall colours in every Ring are {illeg} <559r> then others according to their degree of refrangibility which meanes the colours on one side of the Ring become more unfolded & dilated & on the other side more complicated & contracted. And where by a due refraction they are so much contracted that the severall Rings become narrower then to interfere with one another, they must appear distinct & also white if the constituent colors be so much contracted as to be wholy coincident. But on the other side where every Ring is made broader by the further unfolding of its colours, it must interfere more with other Rings then before & so become lesse distinct
To explain this a little further, suppose the concentrick circles AB and CD represent the red & Violet of any order which together with the intermediate colours constitute any one of these Rings. Now these being viewed through a Prism the Violet circle BC will by a greater refraction be further translated from its place then the Red AD & so approach nearer to it on that side towards which the refractions are made. For instance, if the Red be translated to ad the Violet may be translated to bc so as to approach nearer to it at c then before, & if the Red be further translated to ad the Violet may be so much further translated to bc as to convene with it at c, & if the Red be yet further translated to αδ, the Violet may be still so much further translated to βγ as to pass beyond it at γ & convene with it at e & f. And this being understood not only of the Red & Violet but of all the other intermediate colours, & also of every revolution of those colours, you will easily perceive how these of the same revolution or order by their nearnesse {at} cd & δγ & their coincidence at cd, e, & f ought to constitute pretty distinct arcs of circles, especially at cd or at e & f {&} that they will appear severall at cd, at cd exhibit whitenesse by their coincidence, & again appear severall at δγ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before & still retain beyond e and f. But on the other side at ab, ab, {illeg} αβ these colours must become much more confused <559v> by being dilated & spread soe as to interfere with those of other orders. And the same confusion will happen at δγ between e & f if the refraction be very great, or the Prism very distant from the Object-Glasses. in which case no parts of the Ring will be seen save only two little Arcs at e & f whose distance from one another will be augmented by removing the Prism still further from the Object-Glasses. And these little Arcs must be distinctest & whitest at their middle, & at their ends where they begin to grow confused, they must be coloured. And the colours at one end of every Arc must be in a contrary order the those at the other end, by reason that they crosse in the intermediate white. Namely their ends which verge towards δγ will be red & yellow on that side next the center & blew & Violet on the other side. But their other ends which verge from δγ will on the contrary be blew & Violet on that side towards the center & on the other side red & yellow.
For confirmation of all this I need alledge no more than that it is mathematically demonstrable from my former Principles. But yet I shall add that they which please to take the pains, may by the Testimony of their senses be assured that these explications are not Hypotheticall but infallibly true & genuine. For in a dark Room by viewing these Rings through a Prism by reflexion of the severall Prismatiq3 colours which an Assistant causes to move to & fro upon a wall or paper from whence they are reflected, whilst the spectators eye, the Prism & Object-glasses (as in the 13 observation) are placed steddy: the position of the circles made successively by the severall colours will be found such in respect of one another as I have described at abcd, or abcd or αβγδ. And by the same Method, the truth of the {explications} {of}the other Observations, is to be examined. 
By what hath been said, the the like {illeg} Bubbles & thin Plates of Glasse may be {illeg} small fragments of those Plates there is {illeg} servable, that if they lying flatt {illeg} <560r> be turned about their centers whilst they are viewed through a Prism: some of them exhibit waves in one or two positions only, but the most of them do in all positions exhibit those waves & that for the most part appearing, almost all over the Glasse. The reason is that the superficies of such Plates are not eaven but have many cavities & swellings which how shallow soever do a little vary the thicknesse of the Plate: And by the severall sides of those cavities there must be produced waves in severall postures of the Prism. Now though it be but some very small and narrow parts of the Glasse by which these waves for the most part are caused yet they may seem to extend themselves over the whole Glasse, because from the narrowest of those parts there are colours of severall orders confusedly reflected which by refraction of the Prism are unfolded & dispersed to severall places so as to constitute so many severall waves as there were divers orders of the colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the Glasse.
These are the Principall Phænomena of thin Plates or Bubbles whose explications depend on the Properties of light that I have heretofore delivered: And these you see doe neccessarily follow from them & agree with them even to their very least circumstances; & not onely so, but doe very much tend to their proof. Thus by the 24th Observation it appears that the rayes of severall colours made as well by thin Plates or Bubbles as by the refractions of a Prism have severall degrees of refrangibility, whereby those of each order which at their reflexion from the Plate or Bubble are intermixed with those of other orders, are seperated from them by refraction, & associated together so as to become visible by themselves like Arcs of Circles. For if the rayes were all alike refrangible, 'tis impossible that the whitenesse which to the naked sense appears uniform should by refraction have its parts transposed & ranged into those black & white Arcs.
It appears also that the unequall refractions {difform} rayes proceed not from any contingent irregularities. Such as are V{illeg}, an uneaven polish, or for fortuitous position of the pores of the Glasse; unequall motions in the Air or Æther{.} <560v> spreading, breaking or dividing the same ray into many diverging parts; or the like. For admitting any such irregularities, it would be impossible for refractions to render those Rings so very distinct & well defined, as they doe in the 24th Observation. It is necessary therefore that every ray have its proper & constant degree of refrangibility connate with it, according to which its refraction is ever justly & regularly performed; & that severall rayes have severall of those degrees.
And what is said of their Refrangibility may be also understood of their Reflexibility, that is of their dispositions to be reflected some at a greater & others at a lesse thicknesse of thin Plates or Bubbles, namely that those dispositions are also connate with the rayes & immutable{,} as may appear by the 13th 14th & 15th Observations compared with the 4th & 18th.
By the precedent Observations it appears also that whitenesse is a dissimilar mixture of all colours, & that light is a mixture of rayes endewed with all those colours. For considering the multitude of the Rings of colours in the 3d, 12t, & 24th Observations, it is manifest that although in the 4th & 18th Observations there appear noe more than 8 or 9 of those Rings, yet there are really a far greater number which soe much interfere & mingle with one another as after those 8 or 9 revolutions to dilute one another wholy & constitute an eaven & sensibly uniforme whitenesse. And consequently that whitenesse must be allowed a mixture of all colours, & the light which conveys it to the eye must be a mixture of rayes endewed with all those colours.
But further by the 24th Observation it {illeg} is a constant relation between colours & {illeg} refrangible rayes being Violet, the least {illeg} of intermediate colours having proportionally {illeg} <561r> refrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th, & 15th Observations compared with the 4th or 18th, there appears to be the same constant relation between colour & reflexibility, the Violet being on equall termes reflected at least thicknesse of any thin Plate or Bubble, the Red at greatest thicknesse, & the intermediate colours at intermediate thicknesses. Whence it followes that the colorifiq3 dispositions of rayes are also connate with them & immutable, & by consequence that all the productions & appearances of colours in the world are derived not from any Physicall change caused in light by refraction or reflexion but only from the various mixtures or seperations of rayes by virtue of their different Refrangibility or Reflexibility. And in this respect it is that the science of colours becomes a speculation more proper for Mathematicians then naturalists, 
I am now come to the last part of this design which is to consider how the Phænomena of thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all other naturall bodies. Of these bodies I have already told you that they appear of divers colours accordingly as they are disposed to reflect most copious by the rayes endewed with those colours. But their constitutions wherby they reflect some rayes more copiously then others, remaines to be enquired after. And this I shall endeavour in the following Propositions.
Prop.1. Those superficies reflect the greatest quantity of light which have the greatest refracting power, that is, which intercede mediums that differ most in their refracting densities. And in the confines of equally dense mediums there is noe reflexon.
The analogy between reflexion & refraction will appear by considering that when light passeth obliq3ly out of one Medium into another which refracts from the perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their density the lesse obliquity is requisite to cause a totall reflexion; because as the sines are which measure the refraction, so is the sine of incidence at which the totall reflexion begins, to the radius {of} the circle, & consequently that incidence is least <561v> where there is the greatest difference of the sines. Thus in the passing of light out of water into Air where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 3 to 4 the totall reflexion begins when the angle of incidence is sbout 48degr 35min. In passing out of Glasse into Air where the refraction is measured by the ratio of the sines 20 to 31 the totall reflexion begins when the angle of incidence is 40degr. 10min. And so in passing out of Crystall or more strongly refracting Mediums into Air, there is still a lesse obliquity requisite to cause a totall reflexion. Superficies therfore which refract most do soonest reflect all the light which is incident on them, & so must be allowed most strongly reflective.
But the truth of this Proposition will further appear by observing that in the superficies interceding any two of those Mediums, Air of water or other liquors, common Glasse, Crystall, & Metalline Glasses, the reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly as the superficies hath a greater or lesse refracting power. Thus when other Mediums are contiguous to Air; the reflexion is stronger in the superficies of Glasse then of water; still stronger in the superficies of Crystall, & strongest in the superficies of metalline Glasse. So in the confine of water & common Glasse the reflexion is very weak, but yet stronger then in the confine of water & oyle or almost any other two liquors, & still stronger in the confine of water & Crystall or Metalline Glasse: accordingly as those Mediums differ more or lesse in density. So in the confine of common Glasse & Chrystall there is a weak reflexion & a stronger reflexion in the confine of common & mealline Glasse. But in the confine of two Glasses of equall density, there is not any sensible reflexion as was shown in the 1st Observation. And the same may be understood of the superficies of two Crystalls or liquors or any other substances in which no refraction is caused. Whence it comes to passe that uniform Mediums have no sensible reflexion but in their externall superficies where they are adjacent to other Mediums of a different densi{ity.}
Prop: 2. The least parts of naturall bodies {are} in {some}measure transparent; And the opacity of those {illeg} the multitude of reflexions caused caused in their {illeg}
That this is so will easily be granted {illeg} been conversant with Microscopes. <562r> And it may be also tried by applying any substance to a hole through which some light is immitted into a dark room For how opake sooner that substance may seem in the open Air, it will by that means appear very manifestly transparent if it be of a sufficient thinnesse. Onely metalline bodies must be exempted which by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the light incident on their first superficies.
Prop: 3: Between the parts of opake or coloured bodies are many interstices replenished with mediums of other densities: as water between the tinging corpuscles wherwith any liquor is impregnated; Air between the aqueous globules that constitute Clouds or mists; & for the most part spaces void of both Air & water; but yet perhaps replenished with some subtiler Medium between the parts of hard bodies.
The truth of this is evinced by the two precedent Propositions, For by the second Proposition there are many reflexions from the internall parts of bodies, which by the 1st Proposition would not happen if the parts of those bodies were continued without any such interstices between them, because reflexions are caused only in superficies which intercede Mediums of a differing density.
But further that this discontinuity of parts is the Principall cause of the opacity of bodies will appear by considering that opake substances become transparent by filling their pores with any substance of equall or almost equall density with their parts. Thus paper dipped in water or oyle, the oculus mundi stone steeped in water, linnen cloth oyl'd or varnished, & many other substances soaked in such liquors as will intimately pervade their little pores become by that means more transparent then otherwise. So on the contrary the most transparent substances may by seperating their parts be rendered sufficiently opake, as Glasse by being reduced to powder or otherwise flawed, water by being formed into many small bubbles either alone in the form of froth, or by shaking it together with oyle of Turpentine or some other convenient liquor with which it will not incorporate, & Horn by being scraped.
<562v>
To the increase of of the opacity of these bodies it conduces something that by the 23d Observation the reflexions of very thin transparent substances are considerably stronger then those made by the same substances of a greater thicknesse. And to the reflexion of solid bodies it may further add, that the interstices of their parts are void of Air. For that for the most part they are so is reasonable to beleive considering the ineptitude which Air hath to pervade small cavities as appears by the ascention of water in slender glasse pipes, paper, cloth & other such like substances whose pores are found too small to be replenished with Air, & yet large enough to admit water; & by the difficulty wherewith Air pervades the pores of a Bladder through which water finds ready passage. And according to the 11th Observation the cavities thus void of Air will cause the same kind of effects as to reflexion which those doe that are replenished with it, but yet something more manifestly because the Medium in relation to refractions is rarest when most empty of Air as Mr Hook hath proved in his Micrographia. In which Book he hath also largely discoursed of this & precedent Proposition, & declined many other very excellent things concerning the colours of thin Plates & other naturall bodies which I have not scrupled to make use of so far as they were for my purpose.
Prop: 4. The parts of bodies & their interstices must not be lesse then of some definite bignesse to render them opake & coloured. For the opakest bodies if their parts be subtily divided (as Metalls by being dissolved in acid Menstruums, &c) become perfectly transparent. And you may also remember that in the 8th Observation there was no reflexion at the superficies of the Object-glasses where they were very near one another though they did not {abso}lutely touch. And in the 17th Observation {illeg} {illeg} the water-bubble where it became thin {illeg} insensible so as to cause the apparitions {illeg} spots.
<563r>
On these grounds I conceive it is that water, salt, glasse, stones & such like substances are transparent For upon divers considerations they seem to be as porous as other bodies, but yet their pores & parts too small to cause any opacity.
Prop: 5. The transparent parts of bodies according to their severall sizes must reflect rayes of one colour, & transmitt those of another, on the same grounds that thinne plates or Bubbles doe reflect or transmitt those rayes. And this I take to be the ground of all their colours.
For if a thin'd or plated body which being of an eaven thicknesse appeares all over of {one} uniform colour should be broken into fragments of the same thicknesse with the plate, I see noe reason why a heap of those fragments should not constitute a powder of the same colour which the Plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all naturall bodies being like soe many fragments of a Plate must on the same grounds exhibit the same colours.
Now that they doe soe will further appear by the affinity of their properties. As that the infusion of Nephritic wood & many other substances reflect one colour & transmitt another like thin bodies in the 9th & 20th Observations. That the colours of silks, cloths, & other substances which water or oyle can intimately penetrate become more faint & obscure by being immmerged in those liquors, & recover their vigor again by being dryed much after the manner declared of thin bodies in the 10th & 21 Observations. And that some of those coloured powders which Painters use may have their colours a little changed by being very elaborately & finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes besides the breaking of their parts into lesse parts by that contrition after the same manner that the colour of a Plate is changed by varying its thicknesse. For which reason also it is that many flowers by being bruised become more transparent then before; or at least <563v> in some degree or another change their colours. Nor is it much lesse to my purpose that by mixing divers liquors very odd & remarkable productions & changes of colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious & naturall than that the saline corpuscles of one liquor do variously act upon or unite with the tinging corpuscles of another, so as to make them swell or shrink (whereby not only their bulk but their density also may be changed) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, or make many of them associate into one cluster; For wee see how apt those saline Menstruums are to penetrate & dissolve substances to which they are applyed & some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner if wee consider the various Phæ nomena of the Atmosphere, wee may observe that when vapours are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflexion in their superficies. But when in order to compose drops of rain they begin to coalesce & constitute globules of all intermediate sizes, those globules when they become of a convenient size to reflect some colours & transmitt others, may constitute clouds of various colours acording to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a substance as water for the production of these colours besides the various sizes of its parcells, which seem to affect a globular figure most; but yet perhaps not without some instability in the smallest of them by reason that those are most easily agitated by heat or any trembling motions in the Air.
Prop: 6. Then parts of Bodies on which their colours depend are denser then the medium which pervades the interstices.
This will appear by considering that the colour {illeg} body depends not only on the rayes which are {illeg}pendicularly on its parts, but on those {also} {illeg}dent at all other angles. And that {illeg} <564r> 7th Observation a very little variation of obliquity will change the reflected colour where the thinne body or small particle is rarer then the ambient Medium, in so much that such a small particle will at diversly oblique incidences reflect all sorts of colours in so great a variety that the colour resulting from them all confusedly reflected from a heap of such particles must rather be a white or grey then any other colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect & dirty colour. Whereas if the thin Body or small particle be much denser then the ambient Medium, the colours according to the 19th Observation are so little changed by the variation of obliquity, that the rayes which are reflected least obliq3ly, may predominate over the rest so much as to cause a heap of such particles to appear very intensly of their colour.
It conduces also something to this Proposition that according to 22th Observation, the colours exhibited by the denser thin body within the rarer are more brisq3 then those exhibited by the rarer within the denser.
Prop: 7th. The bignesse of the component parts of naturall bodies may be conjectured by their colours.
For since the parts of those bodies by Prop: 5 doe most probably exhibit the same colours with a plate of equall thicknesse, provided they have the same refractive density; & since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with water or glasse, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect: to determine the sizes of those parts you need only have recourse to the precedent Tables in which the thicknesse of water or Glasse exhibiting any colour is expressed. Thus if it be desired to {illeg} the diameter of a corpuscle which being of equall density with glasse, shall reflect Green of the third order; the number  showes it to be about  parts of an inch. The greatest difficulty is here to know of what order <564v> the colour of any body is. And for this end wee must have recourse to the 4th & 18th Observations from whence may be collected these perticulars.
Scarlets & other Reds, Oreanges & yellows if they be pure & intense are most probably of the second order. Those of the first & third order also may be pretty good, only the Orange & Red of the third order have too great a mixture of Violet & Blew.
There may be good Greens of the fourth order but the purest are of the third. And of this order the Green of all Vegetables seems to be, partly by reason of the intensnesse of their colours, & partly because when they wither some of them turn to a greenish yellow, & others to a more perfect yellow or Orange or perhaps to Red, passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate colours. which changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture which may leave the tinging corpuscles more dense, & something augmented by the accretion of the oyly & earthy part of that moisture. Now the Green without doubt is of the same order with those colours into which it changeth because the changes are graduall & those colours though usually not very pure yet for the most part are too pure & lively to be of the fourth order.
Blewes & Purples may be either of the second or third order. But the best are of the third. Thus the colour of Violets seems to be of that order, because their syrrup by acid liquors turnes red and by urinous & alcalizate turn green. For since it is of the nature of acids to dissolve or attenuate, & of Alcalies to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple colour of the syrrup was of the second order, an acid liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would change it to {illeg} Red of the first order, & an Alcaly by {incrassate} them would change it to a green of the second {illeg} red & Green, especially the Green, seem {illeg} be the colours produced by these {changes} {illeg} <565r> But if the said purple be supposed of the third order its change to red of the second & green of the third may without any inconvenience be allowed.
If there be found any body of a deeper & lesse reddish purple then that of Violets its colour most probably, is of the second order. But yet there being no body commonly known whose colour is constantly more deep then theirs, I have made use of their name to denote the deepest & least reddish Purples, such as manifestly transcend their colour in purity.
The Blew of the first Order though very faint & little, may possibly be the colour of some substances. And perticularly the Azure colour of the skys seems to be of this order. For all vapors when they begin to condense & coalesce into small parcells, become first of that bignesse whereby such an Azure must be reflected before they can constitute clouds of other colours. And so this being the first colour which vapors begin to reflect, it ought to be the colour of the finest & most transparent skys in which vapors are not arrived to that grossnesse requisite to reflect other colours as we find it is by experience.
Whitenesse if it be intense is either that in the first order of colours, of which sort perhaps is the colour of white lead; or else it is a mixture of those succeeding the third or fourth order, such as is the colour of paper, linnen, & most white substances. If corpuscles of various sizes exhibiting the colours of the second & third order be mixed, they should rather constitute an imperfect whitenesse or Grey of which I have already spoken. But yet it seems not impossible for them to exhibit an intense whitenesse {if} they be disposed to transmitt all the light which they reflect not, & do not retain & stifle much of it. For thus I told you that froth at a distance hath appeared very white & yet near at hand the severall Bubbles of which it was constituted were seen tinged all over with Rings of colours of the four or five first orders.
<565v>
Lastly for the production of Black the corpuscles must be lesse then any of those which exhibit colours. For at all greater sizes there is too much light reflected to constitute this colour. But if they be supposed a little lesse then is requisite to reflect the blew of the first order they will according to the 4th , 8th, 17th, & 18th Observations reflect so very little light as to appear intensely black, & yet may perhaps variously refract it to & fro within themselves so long untill it happen to be stifled & lost, by which meanes they will appear black in all positions of the eye without any transparency. And from hence may be understood why Fire & the more subtile dissolver Putrefaction turne substances to black; why small quantities of black substances impart their colour very freely & intensely to other substances to which they are applied;* why Glasse ground very elaborately with sand on a Copper plate till it be well polished makes the sand together with what is worne off from the Glasse, & copper become very black; why black substances do soonest of all others become hot & burne, which effect may proceed partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, & partly from the easie commotion of so very small corpuscles; & why blacks are usually a little inclined to a blewish colour. For that they are so may be seen by illuminating white paper by reflexion from black substances, which will usually appear of a blewish white. And the reason is that black bodies on the obscure blew of the first order, as described in the 18th Observation, whence the corpuscles of black substances are most apt to reflect that colour.
In these descriptions I have been the more {popu}lar because its not impossible but that Microscopes may {illeg} be improved to the discovery of corpuscles {illeg} which their colours depend. For if those {illeg} be so far improved as with sufficient {illeg} represent objects five or six hundred {illeg} <566r> then at a foot distance they appear to our naked eyes I should hope that wee might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles. And by one that would magnifie three or four thousand times perhaps they might all be discovered but those which produce blacknesse. In the mean while I see nothing material that rationally can be doubted of excepting this Position. That transparent corpuscles of the same thicknesse & density with a Plate, do exhibit the same colour. And this I would have understood not without some latitude, as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular figures, & many rayes must be obliq3ly incident, & so have a shorter way through them then the length of their diameter, as because the straitnesse of the Medium pent in on all sides may a little alter its motions or other qualities on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last because I have observed of some small plates of Moscovy-Glasse which were of an eaven thicknesse, that through a Microscope they have appeared of the same colour at their edges & corners where included the Medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it would add much to our satisfaction if those corpuscles can be discovered with Microscopes, which if wee shall ever attain to I fear it will be the utmost improvement of this sense. For it seems impossible to see the more secret & noble works of Nature within those corpuscles by reason of their transparency.
This may suffice concerning the constitution of naturall bodies on which their colours depend. But for further understanding the nature of reflexions I shall add these two following Propositions.
Prop: 8. The cause of Reflexion is not the impinging of light on the solid & impervious parts of bodies, as is commonly supposed.
This will appear by the following consideration First that in the passage of light out of glasse into Air <566v> there is a reflexion as strong or stronger then in its passage out of Air into Glasse & by many degrees stronger then in its passage out of Glasse into water. And it seems not probable that Air should have more reflecting parts then water or Glasse. But if that should possibly be supposed it will availe nothing: for the reflexion is as strong if not stronger when the Air is drawn away from the Glasse, (suppose in the Air-Pump invented by Mr Boyle) as when it is adjacent to it. Secondly, if light in its passage out of Glasse into Air be incident more obliq3ly then at an angle of 40 or 41 degrees it is wholly reflected, if lesse obliquely it is in great measure transmitted. Now it is not to be imagined that light at one degree of obliquity should meet with pores enough in the Air to transmitt the greater part of it, & at another degree of obliquity meet with nothing but parts to reflect it wholly: especially considering that in its passage out of Air into Glasse, how oblique soever be its incidence it finds pores enough in the Glass to transmitt the greatest part of it; If any man suppose that it is not reflected by the Air but by the utmost superficiall parts of the Glasse, there is still the same difficulty: besides that such a supposition is unintelligible, & will also appear to be false by applying water behind some part of the Glasse instead of Air. For so in a convenient obliquity of the rayes suppose of 45 or 46 degrees at which they are all reflected where the Air is adjacent to the Glasse, they shall be in great measure transmitted where the water is adjacent to it: which argues that their reflexion or {trans}mission depends on the constitution of the Air & water. hind the glass, & not on the parts of the glass Thirdly if the colours made by a Prism placed at the {illeg} of a beam of light into a darkned Room {illeg} cast on a second Prism placed at a {illeg} the former, in such manner that they {illeg} incident upon it: the second Prism {illeg} <567r> to the incident rayes that those which are of a blew colour shall be all reflected by it, & yet those of a red colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if the reflexion be caused by the parts of Air or Glasse I would ask why at the same obliquity of incidence the blew should wholly impinge on those parts so as to be all reflected & yet the red find pores enough to be in great measure transmitted. Fourthly where two Glasses touch one another there is no sensible reflexion as was declared in the 1st Observation; & yet I see no reason why the rayes should not impinge on the parts of Glasse when contiguous to one another Glasse as much as when contiguous to Air. Firstly when the top of a water-Bubble (in the 17th Observation) by the continuall subsiding & exhaling of the water grew very thin there was such a little & almost insensible quantity of light reflected from it that it appeared intensly black, wheras round about that black spot where the water was thicker the reflexion was soe strong as to make the water seem very white. Nor is it onely at the least thicknesse of thin Plates or Bubbles that there is no manifest reflexion but at many other thicknesses continually greater & greater. For in the 15th Observation the rayes of the same colour were by turnes transmitted at one thicknesse & reflected at another thicknesse for an indeterminate number of successions. And yet in the superficies of the thin'd body where it is of any one thicknesse there are as many parts for the rayes to impinge on, as where it is of any other thicknesse. Lastly if reflexion were caused by the parts of reflecting bodies it would be impossible for thin Plates or Bubbles at the same place to reflect the rayes of one colour & transmitt those of another as they do according to the 13 & 15 Observations. For it is not to be immagined that at one place the rayes which for instance exhibit a blew colour should have the fortune to dash upon the parts & those which exhibit a Red to let upon the <567v> Pores of the body; & then at another place {soe} the Body is either a little thicker, or a little thinner {illeg} that on the contrary the Blew should hit upon its pores & the Red upon its parts.
Prop: 9. 'Tis most probable that the rayes which impinge on the solid parts of any body, are not reflected but shifted & lost in that body.
This is consentaneous to the Precedent Proposition & will further appear by considering that if all the rayes should be reflected which impinge on the internall parts of clear water or Crystall, those substances should rather have a cloudy then so very clear transparency. And further there would be no Principle of the obscurity or blacknesse which some bodies have in all positions of the eye. For to produce this effect it is necessary that many rayes be retained & lost in the body & it seems not probable that any rayes can be stopt & retained in it which do not impinge on its parts.

Newton's Demonstration that planets move in ellipses
<1r>
Hypoth. 1. Bodies move uniformly in straight lines unless so far as they are retarded by the resistence of the Medium or disturbed by some other force.
Hyp. 2. The alteration of motion is ever proportional to the force by which it is altered.
Hyp. 3. Motions imprest in two different lines, if those lines be taken in proportion to the motions & completed into a parallelogram, compose a motion whereby the diagonal of the Parallelogram shall be described in the same time in which the sides thereof would have been described by those compounding motions apart. The  motions AB & AC compound the motion AD.
Prop. 1.
If a body move in vacuo & be continually attracted toward an immoveable center, it shall constantly move in one & the same plane, & in that plane describe equal areas in equall times.
Let A be the center towards which the body  is attracted, & suppose the attraction acts not continually but by discontinued impressions made at equal intervalls of time which intervalls we will consider as physical moments. Let BC be the right line in which it begins to move from B & which it describes with uniform motion in the first physical moment before the attraction make its first impression upon it. At C let it be attracted towards the center A by one impuls or impression of force, & let CD be the line in which it shall move after that impuls. Produce BC to I so that CI be equall to BC & draw ID parallel to CA & the point D in which it cuts CD shall be the place of the body at the end of the second moment. And because the bases BC CI of the triangles ABC, ACI are equal those two triangles shall be equal. Also because the triangles ACI, ACD stand upon the same base AC & between two parallels they shall be equall. And therefore the triangle ACD described in the second moment shall be equal to the triangle ABD described in the first moment. And by the same reason if the body at the end of the 2d, 3d, 4th, 5t & following moments be attracted by single impulses in <1r> D, E, F, G &c describing the line DE in the 3d moment, EF in the 4th, FG in the 5t &c: the triangle AED shall be equall to the triangle ADC & all the following triangles AFE, AGF & to the preceding ones & to one another. And by consequence the areas compounded of these equall triangles (as ABE, AEG, ABG &c) are to one another as the times in which they are described. Suppose now that the moments of time be diminished in length & encreased in number in infinitum, so that the impulses or impressions of the attraction may become continuall & that the line BCDEFG by the infinite number & infinite littleness of its sides BC, CD, DE &c may become a curve one: & the body by the continual attraction shall describe areas of this Curve ABE, AEG, ABG & proportionall to the times in which they are described. W. W. to be Dem.
Prop. 2.
If a body be attracted towards either focus of an Ellipsis & the quantity of the attraction be such as suffices to make the body revolve in the circumference of the Ellipsis: the attraction at the two ends of the Ellipsis shall be reciprocally as the squares of the body in those ends from that focus.
Let AECD be the Ellipsis, A, C its two  ends or vertices, F that focus towards which the body is attracted, & AFE, CFD areas which the body with a ray drawn from that focus to its center, describes at both ends in equal times: & those areas by the foregoing Proposition must be equal because proportionall to the times: that is the rectangles  &  must be equal supposing the arches AE & CD to be so very short that they may be taken for right lines & therefore AE is to CD as FC to FA. Suppose now that AM & CN are tangents to the Ellipsis at its two ends A & C & that EM & DN are perpendiculars let fall from the points E & D upon those tangents: & because the Ellipsis is alike crooked at both ends those perpendiculars EM & DN will be to one another as the squares of the arches AE & CD, & therefore EM is to DN as FCq to FAq. Now in the times that the body by means of the attraction moves in the arches AE <2r> & CD from A to E & from C to D it would without attraction move in the tangents from A to M & from C to N. Tis by the force of the attractions that the bodies are drawn out of the tangents from M to E & from N to D & therefore the attractions are as those distances ME & ND, that is the attraction at the end of the Ellipsis A is to the attraction at the other end of the Ellipsis C as ME to ND & by consequence as FCq to FAq. W. w. to be dem.
Lemma. 1.
If a right line touch an Ellipsis in any point thereof & parallel to that tangent be drawn another right line from the center of the Ellipsis which shall intersect a third right line drawn from the touch point through either focus of the Ellipsis: the segment of the last named right line lying between the point of intersection & the point of contact shall be equal to half the long axis of the Ellipsis.
Let APBQ be the Ellipsis; AB its  long axis; C its center; F, f its Foci; P the point of contact; PR the tangent; CD the line parallel to the tangent, & PD the segment of the line FP. I say that this segment shall be equal to AC.
For joyn Pf & draw fE parallel to CD & because Ff is bisected in C, FE shall be bisected in D & therefore 2PD shall be equal to the summ of PF & PE that is to the summ of PF & Pf, that is to AB & therefore PD shall be equal to AC. W. W. to be Dem.
Lemma. 2.
Every line drawn through either Focus of any Ellipsis & terminated at both ends by the Ellipsis is to that diameter of the Ellipsis which is parallel to this line as the same Diameter is to the long Axis of the Ellipsis.
Let APBQ be the Ellipsis, AB its long Axis, F, f its foci, C its center, PQ the line drawn through its focus F, & VCS its diameter parallel to PQ & PQ will be to VS as VS to AB.
For draw fp parallel to QFP & cutting the Ellipsis in p. Joyn Pp cutting VS in T & draw PR which shall touch the <2v> Ellipsis in P & cut the diameter VS produced in R & CT will be to CS as CS to CR, as has been shewed by all those who treat of the Conic sections. But CT is the semisumm of FP & fp that is of FP & FQ & therefore 2CT is equal to PQ. Also 2CS is equal to VS & (by the foregoing Lemma) 2CR is equal to AB. Wherefore PQ is to VS as VS to AB. W. W. to be Dem.
Corol. .
Lem. 3.
If from either focus of any Ellipsis unto any point in the perimeter of the Ellipsis be drawn a right line & another right line doth touch the Ellipsis in that point & the angle of contact be subtended by any third right line drawn parallel to the first line: the rectangle which that subtense conteins with the same subtense produced to the other side of the Ellipsis is to the rectangle which the long Axis of the Ellipsis conteins with the first line produced to the other side of the Ellipsis as the square of the distance between the subtense & the first line is to the square of the short Axis of the Ellipsis.
Let AKBL be the Ellipsis, AB  its long Axis, KL its short Axis, C its center, F, f its foci, P the point of the perimeter, PF the first line PQ that line produced to the other side of the Ellipsis PX the tangent, XY the subtense produced to the other side of the Ellipsis & YZ the distance between this subtense & the first line. I say that the rectangle YXI is to the rectangle  as YZq to KLq
For let VS be the diameter of the Ellipsis parallel to the first line PF & GH another diameter parallel to the tangent PX, & the rectangle YXI will be to the square of the tangent PXq as the rectangle SCV to the rectangle GCH that is as SVq to GHq. This a property of the Ellipsis demonstrated by all that write of the conic sections. And they have also demonstrated that all the Parallelogramms circumscribed about an Ellipsis are equall. Whence the rectangle  is equal to the rectangle  & consequently GH is to KL as AB that is (by Lem. 1) 2PD to 2PE & in the same proportion is PX to YZ. Whence PX is to GH as YZ to KL & PXq to GHq as YZq to KLq. But <3r> YXI was to PXq as SVq that is (by Cor. Lem. 2)  to GHq, whence invertedly YXI is to  as PXq to GHq & by consequence as YZq to KLq. W. w. to be Dem.
Prop. III.
If a body be attracted towards either focus of any Ellipsis & by that attraction be made to revolve in the Perimeter of the Ellipsis: the attraction shall be reciprocally as the square of the distance of the body from that focus of the Ellipsis.
Let P be the place of the body in the Ellipsis at any moment of time & PX the tangent in which the body would move uniformly were it not attracted & X the place in that tangent at which it would arrive in any given part of time & Y the place in the perimeter of the Ellipsis at which the body doth arrive in the same time by means of the attraction. Let us suppose the time to be divided into equal parts & that those parts are very little ones so that they may be considered as physical moments & that the attraction acts not continually but by intervalls once in the beginning of every physical moment & let the first action be upon the body in P, the next upon it in Y & so on perpetually, so that the body may move from P to Y in the chord of the arch PY & from Y to its next place in the Ellipsis in the chord of the next arch & so on for ever. And because the attraction in P is made towards F & diverts the body from the tangent PX into the chord PY so that in the end of the first physical moment it be not found in the place X where it would have been without the attraction but in Y being by the force of the attraction in P translated from X to Y: the line XY generated by the force of the attraction in P must be proportional to that force & parallel to its direction that is parallel to PF Produce XY & PF till they cut the Ellipsis  in I & Q. Ioyn FY & upon FP let fall the perpendicular YZ & let AB be the long Axis & KL the short Axis of the Ellipses. And by the third Lemma YXI will be to  as YZq to KLq & by consequence YX will be equall to .
And in like manner if py be the chord of another Arch py which the revolving body describes in a physical moment of time & px be the tangent of the Ellipsis at p & xy the subtense of <3v> the angle of contact drawn parallel to pF, & if pF & xy produced cut the Ellipsis in q & i & from y upon pF be let fall the perpendicular yz: the subtense yx shall be equal to  . And therefore YX shall be to yx as  to  , that is as  to  
And because the lines PY py are by the revolving body described in equal times, the areas of the triangles PYF pyF must be equal by the first Proposition; & therefore the rectangles  &  are equal, & by consequence YZ is to yz as pF to PF. Whence  is to  as  to  And therefore YX is to yx as  to .
And as we told you that XY was the line generated in a physical moment of time by the force of the attraction in P, so for the same reason is xy the line generated in the same quantity of time by the force of the attraction in p. And therefore the attraction in P is to the attraction in p as the line XY to the line xy, that is as  to 
Suppose now that the equal lines in which the revolving body describes the lines PY & py become infinitely little, so that the attraction may become continual & the body by this attraction revolve in the perimeter of the Ellipsis: & the lines PQ, XI as also pq, xi becoming coincident & by consequence equal, the quantities  &  will become  & . And therefore the attraction in P will be to the attraction in p as  to , that is reciprocally as the squares of the distances of the revolving bodies from the focus of the Ellipsis. W.

PArt of the ensuing Discourse about Light was written at the desire of some Gentlemen of the Royal Society, in the Year 1675. and then sent to their Secretary, and read at their Meetings, and the rest was added about Twelve Years after to complete the Theory; except the Third Book, and the last Proposition of the Second, which were since put together out of scattered Papers. To avoid being engaged in Disputes about these Matters, I have hitherto delayed the printing, and should still have delayed it, had not the importunity of Friends prevailed upon me. If any other Papers writ on this Subject are got out of my Hands they are imperfect, and were perhaps written before I had tried all the Expertments here set down, and fully satisfied my self about the Laws of Refractions and Composition of Colours. I have here published what I think proper to come abroad, wishing that it may not be translated into another Language without my Consent.
The Crowns of Colours, which sometimes appear about the Sun and Moon, I have endeavoured to give an Account of; but for want of sufficient Observations leave that Matter to be further examined. The Subject of the Third Book I have also left imperfect, not having tried all the <iii> Experiments which I intended when I was about these Matters, nor repeated some of those which I did try, until I had satisfied my self about all their Circumstances. To communicate what I have tried, and leave the rest to others for further Enquiry, is all my Design in publishing these Papers.
In a Letter written to Mr. Leibnitz in the Year 1676. and published by Dr. Wallis, I mentioned a Method by which I had found some general Theorems about squaring Curvilinear Figures, or comparing them with the Conic Sections, or other the simplest Figures with which they may be compared. And some Years ago I lent out a Manuscript containing such Theorems, and having since met with some Things copied out of it, I have on this Occasion made it publick, prefixing to it an, Introduction and subjoining a Scholium concerning that Method. And I have joined with it another small Tract concerning the Curvilinear Figures of the Second Kind, which was also written many Years ago, and made known to some Friends, who have solicited the making it publick.

The First Book of Opticks. Part I (1704)
The FIRST BOOK  OF  OPTICKS.
PART I.
MY Design in this Book is not to explain the Properties of Light by Hypotheses, but to propose and prove them by Reason and Experiments: In order to which, I shall premise the following Definitions and Axioms.
DEFINITIONS.
DEFIN. I.
BY the Rays of Light I understand its least Parts, and those as well Successive in the same Lines as Contemporary in several Lines. For it is manifest that Light consists of parts both Successive and Contemporary; because in the same place you may stop that which comes one moment, and let pass that which comes presently after; and in the same time you may stop it in any one place, and let it pass in any other. For that part of Light which is stopt cannot be the same with that which is let pass. The least Light or part of Light, which may be stopt alone without the rest of the Light, or propagated alone, or do or suffer any <2> thing alone, which the rest of the Light doth not or suffers not, I call a Ray of Light.
DEFIN. II.
Refrangibility of the Rays of Light, is their Disposition to be refracted or turned out of their Way in passing out of one transparent Body or Medium into another. And a greater or less Refrangibility of Rays, is their Disposition to be turned more or less out of their Way in like Incidences on the same Medium. Mathematicians usually consider the Rays of Light to be Lines reaching from the luminous Body to the Body to be illuminated, and the refraction of those Rays to be the bending or breaking of those lines in their passing out of one Medium into another. And thus may Rays and Refractions be considered, if Light is propagated in an instant. But by an Argument taken from the Æquations of the times of the Eclipses of Jupiter's Satellites it seems that Light is propagated in time, spending in its passage from the Sum to us about seven Minutes of time: And therefore I have chosen to define Rays and Refractions in such general terms as may agree to Light in both cases.
DEFIN. III.
Reflexibility of Rays, is their Disposition to be reflected or turned back into the same Medium from any other Medium upon whose Surface they fall. And Rays are more or less reflexible, which are returned back more or less easily. As if Light pass out of Glass into Air, and by being inclined more and more to the common Surface of the Glass and Air, begins at length to be totally reflected by that Surface; those sorts of Rays which at like Incidences are reflected most copiously, or by inclining the Rays begin soonest to be totally reflected, are most reflexible.
<3>
DEFIN. IV.
The Angle of Incidence, is that Angle, which the Line described by the incident Ray contains with the Perpendicular to the reflecting or refracting Surface at the Point of Incidence.
DEFIN. V.
The Angle of Reflection or Refraction, is the Angle which the Line described by the reflected or refracted Ray containeth with the Perpendicular to the reflecting or refracting Surface at the Point of Incidence.
DEFIN. VI.
The Sines of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction, are the Sines of the Angles of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction.
DEFIN. VII.
The Light whose Rays are all alike Refrangible, I call Simple, Homogeneal and Similar; and that whose Rays are some more Refrangible than others, I call Compound, Heterogenal and Dissimilar. The former Light I call Homogeneal, not because I would affirm it so in all respects; but because the Rays which agree in Refrangibility, agree at least in all those their other Properties. Which I consider in the following Discourse.
DEFIN. VIII.
The Colours of Homogeneal Lights, I call Primary, Homogeneal and Simple; and those of Heterogeneal Lights, Heterogeneal and Compound. For these are always compounded of the colours of Homogeneal Lights; as will appear in the following Discourse.
<4>
AXIOMS.
AX. I.
THE Angles of Incidence, Reflexion, and Refraction, lye in one and the same Plane.
AX. II.
The Angle of Reflexion is equal to the Angle of Incidence.
AX. III.
If the Refracted Ray be returned directly back to the Point of Incidence, it shall be refracted into the Line before described by the incident Ray.
AX. IV.
Refraction out of the rarer Medium into the denser, is made towards the Perpendicular, that is, so that the Angle of Refraction be less than the Angle of Incidence.
AX. V.
The Sine of Incidence, is either accurately or very nearly in a given Ratio to the Sine of Refraction.
Whence if that Proportion be known in any one Inclination of the incident Ray, 'tis known in all the Inclinations, and thereby the Refraction in all cases of Incidence on the same refracting Body may be determined. Thus if the Refraction be made out of Air into Water, the Sine of Incidence of the red Light is to the Sine of its Refraction as 4 to 3. If out of Air into Glass, the Sines are <5> as 17 to 11. In Light of other Colours the Sines have other Proportions: but the difference is so little that it need seldom be consdered.
Suppose therefore, that RS represents the Surface of stagnating Water,[Image 1] and that C is the point of Incidence in which any Ray coming in the Air from A in the Line AC is reflected or refracted, and I would know whither this Ray shall go after Reflexion or Refraction: I erect upon the Surface of the Water from the point of Incidence the Perpendicular CP and produce it downwards to Q, and conclude by the first Axiom, that the Ray after Reflexion and Refraction, shall be found somewhere in the Plane of the Angle of Incidence ACP produced. I let fall therefore upon the Perpendicular CP the Sine of Incidence AD, and if the reflected Ray be desired, I produce AD to B so that DB be equal to AD, and draw CB. For this Line CB shall be the reflected Ray; the Angle of Reflexion BCP and its Sine BD being equal to the Angle and Sine of Incidence, as they ought to be by the second Axiom. But if the refracted Ray be desired, I produce AD to H, so that DH may be to AD as the Sine of Refraction to the Sine of Incidence, that is as 3 to 4; and about the Center C and in the Plane ACP with the Radius CA describing a Circle ABE I draw Parallel to the Perpendicular CPQ, the Line HE cutting the circumference in E, and joining CE, this Line CE shall be the Line of the refracted Ray. For if EF be let fall perpendicularly on the Line PQ, this Line EF shall be the Sine of Refraction of the Ray CE, the Angle of Refraction being ECQ; and this Sine EF is equal to DH, and consequently in Proportion to the Sine of Incidence AD as 3 to 4.
<6>
In like manner, if there be a Prism of Glass (that is a Glass bounded with two Equal and Parallel Triangular ends, and three plain and well polished Sides, which meet in three Parallel Lines running from the three Angles of one end to the three Angles of the other end) and if the Refraction of the Light in passing cross this Prism be desired:[Image 2] Let ACB represent a Plane cutting this Prism transversly to its three Parallel lines or edges there where the Light passeth through it, and let dE be the Ray incident upon the first side of the Prism AC where the Light goes into the Glass; and by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11 find EF the first refracted Ray. Then taking this Ray for the Incident Ray upon the second side of the Glass BC where the Light goes out, find the next refracted Ray FG by putting the Proportion of the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction as 11 to 17. For if the Sine of Incidence out of Air into Glass be to the Sine of Refraction as 17 to 11, the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air must on the contrary be to the Sine of Refraction as 11 to 17, by the third Axiom.
Much after the same manner, if ACBD represent a Glass spherically convex on both sides (usually called a Lens, such as is a Burning-glass, or Spectacle-glass, or an Object-glass of a Telescope)[Image 3] and it be required to know how Light falling upon it from any lucid point Q shall be refracted, let QM represent a Ray falling upon any point M of its first spherical Surface ACB, and by erecting a Perpendicular to the Glass at the point M, find the first refracted Ray MN by the Proportion of the Sines 17 to 11. Let that Ray in going out of the Glass be incident upon N, and then find the second refracted Ray Nq by the Proportion of the Sines 11 to 17. And after the <7> same manner may the Refraction be found when the Lens is Convex on one side and Plane or Concave on the other, or Concave on both sides.
AX. VI.
Homogeneal Rays which flow from several Points of any Object, and fall almost Perpendicularly on any reflecting or refracting Plane or spherical Surface, shall afterwards diverge from so many other Points, or be parallel to so many other Lines, or converge to so many other Points, either accurately or without any sensible Error. And the same thing will happen, if the Rays be reflected or refracted successively by two or three or more Plane or spherical Surfaces.
The Point from which Rays diverge or to which they converge may be called their Focus. And the Focus of the incident Rays being given, that of the reflected or refracted ones may be found by finding the Refraction of any two Rays, as above; or more readily thus.
Cas. 1. Let ACB be a reflecting or refracting Plane,[Image 4] and Q the Focus of the incident Rays, and QqC a perpendicular to that Plane. And if this perpendicular be produced to q, so that qC be equal to QC, the point q shall be the Focus Of the reflected Rays. Or if qC be taken on the same side of the Plane with QC and in Proportion to QC as the Sine of Incidence to the Sine of Refraction, the point q shall be the Focus of the refracted Rays.
Cas. 2. Let ACB be the reflecting Surface of any Sphere whose Center is E.[Image 5] Bisect any Radius thereof (suppose EC) in T, and if in that Radius on the same side the point T you take the Points Q and q, so that TQ, TE, and Tq be continual Proportionals, and the point Q be <8> the Focus of the incident Rays, the point q shall be the Focus of the reflected ones.
Cas. 3. Let ACB be the refracting Surface of any Sphere whose Center is E.[Image 6] In any Radius thereof EC produced both ways take ET and Ct severally in such Proportion to that Radius as the lesser of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction hath to the difference of those Sines. And then if in the same Line you find any two Points Q and q, so that TQ be to ET as Et to tq, taking tq the contrary way from t which TQ lieth from T, and if the Point Q be the Focus of any incident Rays, the Point q shall be the Focus of the refracted ones.
And by the same means the Focus of the Rays after two or more Reflexions or Refractions may be found.
Cas. 4. Let ACBD be any refracting Lens,[Image 7] spherically Convex or Concave or Plane on either side, and let CD be its Axis (that is the Line which cuts both its Surfaces perpendicularly, and passes through the Centers of the Spheres,) and in this Axis let F and f be the Foci of the refracted Rays found as above, when the incident Rays on both sides the Lens are parallel to the same Axis; and upon the Diameter Ff bisected in E, describe a Circle. Suppose now that any Point Q be the Focus of any incident Rays. Draw QE cutting the said Circle in T and t, and therein take tq in such proportion to tE as tE or TE hath to TQ. Let tq lye the contrary way from t which TQ doth from T, and q shall be the Focus of the refracted Rays without any sensible Error, provided the Point Q be not so remote from the Axis, nor the Lens so broad as to make any of the Rays fall too obliquely on the refracting Surfaces.
And by the like Operations may the reflecting or refracting Surfaces be found when the two Foci are given, <9> and thereby a Lens be formed, which shall make the Rays flow towards or from what place you please.
So then the Meaning of this Axiom is, that if Rays fall upon any Plane or Spherical Surface or Lens, and before their Incidence flow from or towards any Point Q, they shall after Reflexion or Refraction flow from or towards the Point q found by the foregoing Rules. And if the incident Rays flow from or towards several points Q, the reflected or refracted Rays shall flow from or towards so many other Points q found by the same Rules. Whether the reflected and refracted Rays flow from or towards the Point q is easily known by the situation of that Point. For if that Point be on the same side of the reflecting or refracting Surface or Lens with the Point Q, and the incident Rays flow from the Point Q, the reflected flow towards the Point q and the refracted from it; and if the incident Rays flow towards Q, the reflected flow from q, and the refracted towards it. And the contrary happens when q is on the other side of that Surface.
AX. VII.
Wherever the Rays which come from all the Points of any Object meet again in so many Points after they have been made to converge by Reflexion or Refraction, there they will make a Picture of the Object upon any white Body on which they fall.
So if PR represent any Object without Doors,[Image 8] and AB be a Lens placed at a hole in the Window-shut of a dark Chamber, whereby the Rays that come from any Point Q of that Object are made to converge and meet again in the Point q; and if a Sheet of white Paper be held at q for the Light there to fall upon it: the Picture of that Object PR will appear upon the Paper in its proper shape <10> and Colours. For as the Light which comes from the Point Q goes to the Point q, so the Light which comes from other Points P and R of the Object, will go to so many other correspondent Points p and r (as is manifest by the sixth Axiom;) so that every Point of the Object shall illuminate a correspondent Point of the Picture, and thereby make a Picture like the Object in Shape and Colour, this only excepted that the Picture shall be inverted. And this is the reason of that vulgar Experiment of casting the Species of Objects from abroad upon a Wall or Sheet of white Paper in a dark Room.
In like manner when a Man views any Object PQR,[Image 9] the Light which comes from the several Points of the Object is so refracted by the transparent skins and humours of the Eye, (that is by the outward coat EFG called the Tunica Cornea, and by the crystalline humour AB which is beyond the Pupil mk) as to converge and meet again in so many Points in the bottom of the Eye, and there to paint the Picture of the Object upon that skin (called the Tunica Retina) with which the bottom of the Eye is covered. For Anatomists when they have taken off from the bottom of the Eye that outward and most thick Coat called the Dura Mater, can then see through the thinner Coats the Pictures of Objects lively painted thereon. And these Pictures propagated by Motion along the Fibres of the Optick Nerves into the Brain, are the cause of Vision. For accordingly as these Pictures are perfect or imperfect, the Object is seen perfectly or imperfectly. If the Eye be tinged with any colour (as in the Disease of the Jaundice) so as to tinge the Pictures in the bottom of the Eye with that Colour, then all Objects appear tinged with the same Colour. If the Humours of the Eye by old Age decay, so as by shrinking to make the Cornea and Coat of the Cry <11> stalline Humour grow flatter than before, the Light will not be refracted enough, and for want of a sufficient Refraction will not converge to the bottom of the Eye but to some place beyond it, and by consequence paint in the bottom of the Eye a confused Picture, and according to the indistinctness of this Picture the Object will appear confused. This is the reason of the decay of sight in old Men, and shews why their Sight is mended by Spectacles. For those Convex-glasses supply the defect of plumpness in the Eye, and by encreasing the Refraction make the Rays converge sooner, so as to convene distinctly at the bottom of the Eye if the Glass have a due degree of convexity. And the contrary happens in short-sighted Men whose Eyes are too plump. For the Refraction being now too great, the Rays converge and convene in the Eyes before they come at the bottom; and therefore the Picture made in the bottom and the Vision caused thereby will not be distinct, unless the Object be brought so near the Eye as that the place where the converging Rays convene may be removed to the bottom, or that the plumpness of the Eye be taken off and the Refractions diminished by a Concave-glass of a due degree of Concavity, or lastly that by Age the Eye grow flatter till it come to a due Figure: For short-sighted Men see remote Objects best in Old Age, and therefore they are accounted to have the most lasting Eyes.
AX. VIII.
An Object seen by Reflexion or Refraction, appears in that place from whence the Rays after their last Reflexion or Refraction diverge in falling on the Spectator's Eye.
If the Object A be seen by Reflexion of a Looking-glass m n,[Image 10] it shall appear, not in its proper place A, but <12> behind the Glass at a, from whence any Rays AB, AC, AD, which flow from one and the same Point of the Object, do after their Reflexion made in the Points B, C, D, diverge in going from the Glass to E, F, G, where they are incident on the Spectator's Eyes. For these Rays do make the same Picture in the bottom of the Eyes as if they had come from the Object really placed at a without the interposition of the Looking-glass; and all Vision is made according to the place and shape of that Picture.
In like manner the Object D seen through a Prism appears not in its proper place D,[Image 11] but is thence translated to some other place d situated in the last refracted Ray FG drawn backward from F to d.
And so the Object Q seen through the Lens AB, appears at the place q from whence the Rays diverge in passing from the Lens to the Eye.[Image 12] Now it is to be noted, that the Image of the Object at q is so much bigger or lesser than the Object it self at Q, as the distance of the Image at q from the Lens AB is bigger or less than the distance of the Object at Q from the same Lens. And if the Object be seen through two or more such Convex or Concave-glasses, every Glass shall make a new Image, and the Object shall appear in the place of the bigness of the last Image. Which consideration unfolds the Theory of Microscopes and Telescopes. For that Theory consists in almost nothing else than the describing such Glasses as shall make the last Image of any Object as distinct and large and luminous as it can conveniently be made.
I have now given in Axioms and their Explications the summ of what hath hitherto been treated of in Opticks. For what hath been generally agreed on I content myself to assume under the notion of Principles, in order to what I have further to write. And this may suffice for an <13> Introduction to Readers of quick Wit and good Understanding not yet versed in Opticks: Although those who are already acquainted with this Science, and have handled Glasses, will more readily apprehend what followeth.

LIGHTS which differ in Colour, differ also in Degrees of Refrangibility.
The Proof by Experiments.
Exper. 1 . I took a black oblong stiff Paper terminated by Parallel Sides, and with a Perpendicular right Line drawn cross from one Side to the other, distinguished it into two equal Parts. One of these parts I painted with a red colour and the other with a blew. The Paper was very black, and the Colours intense and thickly laid on, that the Phænomenon might be more conspicuous. This Paper I viewed through a Prism of solid Glass, whose two Sides through which the Light passed to the Eye were plane and well polished, and contained an Angle of about Sixty Degrees: which Angle I call the refracting Angle of the Prism. And whilst I viewed it, I held it before a Window in such manner that the Sides of the Paper were parallel to the Prism, and both those Sides and the Prism were parallel to the Horizon, and the cross Line perpendicular to it; and that the Light which fell from the Window <14> upon the Paper made an Angle with the Paper, equal to that Angle which was made with the same Paper by the Light reflected from it to the Eye. Beyond the Prism was the Wall of the Chamber under the Window covered over with black Cloth, and the Cloth was involved in Darkness that no Light might be reflected from thence, which in passing by the Edges of the Paper to the Eye, might mingle it self with the Light of the Paper and obscure the Phænomenon thereof. These things being thus ordered, I found that if the refracting Angle of the Prism be turned upwards, so that the Paper may seem to be lifted upwards by the Refraction, its blew half will be lifted higher by the Refraction than its red half. But if the refracting Angle of the Prism be turned downward, so that the Paper may seem to be carried lower by the Refraction, its blew half will be carried something lower thereby than its red half. Wherefore in both cases the Light which comes from the blew half of the Paper through the Prism to the Eye, does in like Circumstances suffer a greater Refraction than the Light which comes from the red half, and by consequence is more refrangible.
Illustration. In the Eleventh Figure,[Image 13] MN represents the Window,and DE the Paper terminated with parallel Sides DJ and HE, and by the transverse Line FG distinguished into two halfs, the one DG of an intensely blew Colour, the other FE of an intensely red. And BACcab represents the Prism whose refracting Planes ABba and ACca meet in the edge of the refracting Angle Aa. This edge Aa being upward, is parallel both to the Horizon and to the parallel edges of the Paper DJ and HE. And de represents the Image of the Paper seen by Refraction upwards in such manner that the blew half DG is carried higher to dg than the red half FE is to fe, and therefore <15> suffers a greater Refraction. If the edge of the refracting Angle be turned downward, the Image of the Paper will be refracted downward suppose to δε, and the blew half will be refracted lower to δγ than the red half is to φε.
Exper. 2. About the aforesaid Paper, whose two halfs were painted over with red and blew, and which was stiff like thin Pastboard, I lapped several times a slender thred of very black Silk, in such manner that the several parts of the thred might appear upon the Colours like so many black Lines drawn over them, or like long and slender dark Shadows cast upon them. I might have drawn black Lines with a Pen, but the threds were smaller and better defined. This Paper thus coloured and lined I set against a Wall perpendicularly to the Horizon, so that one of the Colours might stand to the right hand and the other to the left. Close before the Paper at the confine of the Colours below I placed a Candle to illuminate the Paper strongly: For the Experiment was tried in the Night. The Flame of the Candle reached up to the lower edge of the Paper, or a very little higher. Then at the distance of Six Feet and one or two Inches from the Paper upon the Floor I erected a glass Lens four Inches and a quarter broad, which might collect the Rays coming from the several Points of the Paper, and make them converge towards so many other Points at the same distance of six Feet and one or two Inches on the other side of the Lens, and so form the Image of the coloured Paper upon a white Paper placed there; after the same manner that a Lens at a hole in a Window casts the Images of Objects abroad upon a Sheet of white Paper in a dark Room. The aforesaid white Paper, erected perpendicular to the Horizon and to the Rays which fell upon it from the Lens, I moved sometimes towards the Lens, sometimes from it, to find <16> the places where the Images of the blew and red parts of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct. Those places I easily knew by the Images of the black Lines which I had made by winding the Silk about the Paper. For the Images of those fine and slender Lines (which by reason of their blackness were like Shadows on the Colours) were confused and scarce visible, unless when the Colours on either side of each Line were terminated most distinctly. Noting therefore, as diligently as I could, the places where the Images of the red and blew halfs of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct, I found that where the red half of the Paper appeared distinct, the blew half appeared confused, so that the black Lines drawn upon it could scarce be seen; and on the contrary where the blew half appeared most distinct, the red half appeared confused, so that the black Lines upon it were scarce visible. And between the two places where these Images appeared distinct there was the distance of an Inch and a half: the distance of the white Paper from the Lens, when the Image of thered half of the coloured Paper appeared most distinct, being greater by an Inch and an half than the distance of the same white Paper from the Lens when the Image of the blew half appeared most distinct. In like Incidences therefore of the blew and red upon the Lens, the blew was refracted more by the Lens than the red, so as to converge sooner by an Inch and a half, and therefore is more refrangible.
Illustration. In the Twelfth Figure,[Image 14] DE signifies the coloured Paper, DG theb lew half, FE the red half, MN the Lens, HJ the white Paper in that place where the red half with its black Lines appeared distinct, and hi the same Paper in that place where the blew half appeared distinct. The place hi was nearer to the Lens MN than the Place HJ by an Inch and an half.
<17>
Scholium. The same things succeed notwithstanding that some of the Circumstances be varied: as in the first Experiment when the Prism and Paper are any ways inclined to the Horizon, and in both when coloured Lines are drawn upon very black Paper. But in the Description of these Experiments, I have set down such Circumstances by which either the Phænomenon might be rendred more conspicuous, or a Novice might more easily try them, or by which I did try them only. The same thing I have often done in the following Experiments: Concerning all which this one Admonition may suffice. Now from these Experiments it follows not that all the Light of the blew is more Refrangible than all the Light of the red ; For both Lights are mixed of Rays differently Refrangible, So that in the red there are some Rays not less refrangible than those of the blew, and in the blew there are some Rays not more Refrangible than those of the red; But these Rays in proportion to the whole Light are but few, and serve to diminish the Event of the Experiment, but are not able to destroy it. For if the red and blew Colours were more dilute and weak, the distance of the Images would be less than an Inch and a half; and if they were more intense and full, that distance would be greater, as will appear hereafter. These Experiments may suffice for the Colours of Natural Bodies. For in the Colours made by the Refraction of Prisms this Proposition will appear by the Experiments which are now to follow in the next Proposition.
<18>
PROP. II. Theor. II.
The Light of the Sun consists of Rays differently Refrangible.
The Proof by Experiments.
Exper. 3. IN a very dark Chamber at a round hole about one third part of an Inch broad made in the Shut of a Window I placed a Glass Prism, whereby the beam of the Sun's Light which came in at that hole might be refracted upwards toward the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and there form a coloured Image of the Sun. The Axis of the Prism (that is the Line passing through the middle of the Prism from one end of it to the other end parallel to the edge of the Refracting Angle) was in this and the following Experiments perpendicular to the incident Rays. About this Axis I turned the Prism slowly, and saw the refracted Light on the Wall or coloured Image of the Sun first to descend and then to ascend. Between the Descent and Ascent when the Image seemed Stationary, I stopt the Prism, and fixt it in that posture, that it should be moved no more. For in that posture the Refractions of the Light at the two sides of the Refracting Angle, that is at the entrance of the Rays into the Prism and at their going out of it, were equal to one another. So also in other Experiments as often as I would have the Refractions on both sides the Prism to be equal to one another, I noted the place where the Image of the Sun formed by the refracted Light stood still between its two contrary Motions, in the common Period of its progress and regress; and when the Image fell upon that place, I made fast the Prism. And in this Posture, as <19> the most convenient,it is to be understood that all the Prisms are placed in the following Experiments, unless where some other posture is described. The Prism therefore being placed in this posture, I let the refracted Light fall perpendicularly upon a Sheet of white Paper at the opposite Wall of the Chamber, and observed the Figure and Dimensions of the Solar Image formed on the Paper by that Light. This Image was Oblong and not Oval, but terminated with two Rectilinear and Parallel Sides, and two Semicircular Ends. On its Sides it was bounded pretty distinctly, but on its Ends very confusedly and indistinctly, the Light there decaying and vanishing by degrees. The breadth of this Image answered to the Sun's Diameter, and was about two Inches and the eighth part of an Inch, including the Penumbra. For the Image was eighteen Feet and an half distant from the Prism, and at this distance that breadth if diminished by the Diameter of the hole in the Window-shut, that is by a quarter of an Inch, subtended an Angle at the Prism of about half a Degree, which is the Sun's apparent Diameter. But the Length of the Image was about ten Inches and a quarter, and the length of the Rectilinear Sides about eight Inches; and the refracting Angle of the Prism whereby so great a length was made, was 64 degr. With a less Angle the length of the Image was less, the breadth remaining the same. If the Prism was turned about its Axis that way which made the Rays emerge more obliquely out of the second refracting Surface of the Prism, the Image soon became an Inch or two longer, or more; and if the Prism was turned about the contrary way, so as to make the Rays fall more obliquely on the first refracting Surface, the Image soon became an Inch or two shorter. And therefore in trying this Experiment, I was as curious as I could be in placing the Prism by the above-mentioned Rule exactly in <20> such a posture that the Refractions of the Rays at their emergence out of the Prism might be equal to that at their incidence on it. This Prism had some Veins running along within the Glass from one end to the other, which scattered some of the Sun's Light irregularly, but had no sensible effect in increasing the length of the coloured Spectrum. For I tried the same Experiment with other Prisms with the same Success. And particularly with a Prism which seemed free from such Veins, and whose refracting Angle was  Degrees, I found the length of the Image  or 10 Inches at the distance of  Feet from the Prism, the breadth of the hole in the Window-shut being  of an Inch as before. And because it is easie to commit a mistake in placing the Prism in its due posture, I repeated the Experiment four or five times, and always found the length of the Image that which is set down above. With another Prism of clearer Glass and better Pollish, which seemed free from Veins, and whose refracting Angle was  Degrees, the length of this Image at the same distance of  Feet was also about 10 Inches, or . Beyond these Measures for about  or  of an Inch at either end of the Spectrum the Light of the Clouds seemed to be a little tinged with red and violet, but so very faintly that I suspected that tincture might either wholly or in great measure arise from some Rays of the Spectrum scattered irregularly by some inequalities in the Substance and Polish of the Glass, and therefore I did not include it in these Measures. Now the different Magnitude of the hole in the Window-shut, and different thickness of the Prism where the Rays passed through it, and different inclinations of the Prism to the Horizon, made no sensible changes in the length of the Image. Neither did the different matter of <21> the Prisms make any : for in a Vessel made of polished Plates of Glass cemented together in the shape of a Prism and filled with Water, there is the like Success of the Experiment according to the quantity of the Refraction. It is further to be observed, that the Rays went on in right Lines from the Prism to the Image, and therefore at their very going out of the Prism had all that Inclination to one another from which the length of the Image proceeded, that is the Inclination of more than two Degrees and an half. And yet according to the Laws of Opticks vulgarly received, they could not possibly be so much inclined to one another. For let EG represent the Window-shut[Image 15], F the hole made therein through which a beam of the Sun's Light was transmitted into the darkened Chamber, and ABC a Triangular Imaginary Plane whereby the Prism is feigned to be cut transversely through the middle of the Light. Or if you please, let ABC represent the Prism it self, looking directly towards the Spectator's Eye with its nearer end : And let XY be the Sun, MN the Paper upon which the Solar Image or Spectrum is cast, and PT the Image it self whose sides towards V and W are Rectilinear and Parallel, and ends towards P and T Semicircular. YKHP and XLJT are two Rays, the first of which comes from the lower part of the Sun to the higher part of the Image, and is refracted in the Prism at K and H, and the latter comes from the higher part of the Sun to the lower part of the Image, and is refracted at L and J. Since the Refractions on both sides the Prism are equal to one another, that is the Refraction at K equal to the Refraction at J, and the Refraction at L equal to the Refraction at H, so that the Refractions of the incident Rays at K and L taken together are equal to the Refractions of the emergent Rays at H and J taken toge <22> ther : it follows by adding equal things to equal things, that the Refractions at K and H taken together, are equal to the Refractions at J and L taken together, and therefore the two Rays being equally refracted have the same Inclination to one another after Refraction which they had before, that is the Inclination of half a Degree answering to the Sun's Diameter. For so great was the inclination of the Rays to one another before Refraction. So then, the length of the Image PT would by the Rules of Vulgar Opticks subtend an Angle of half a Degree at the Prism, and by consequence be equal to the breadth vw; and therefore the Image would be round. Thus it would be were the two Rays XLJT and YKHP and all the rest which form the Image PwTv, alike refrangible. And therefore seeing by Experience it is found that the Image is not round but about five times longer than broad, the Rays which going to the upper end P of the Image suffer the greatest Refraction, must be more Refrangible than those which go to the lower end T, unless the inequality of Refraction be casual.
This Image or Spectrum PT was coloured, being red at its least refracted end T, and violet at its most refracted end P, and yellow green and blew in the intermediate spaces. Which agrees with the first Proposition, that Lights which differ in Colour do also differ in Refrangibility. The length of the Image in the foregoing Experiments I measured from the faintest and outmost red at one end, to the faintest and outmost blew at the other end.
Exper. 4. In the Sun's beam which was propagated into the Room through the hole in the Window-shut, at the distance of some Feet from the hole, I held the Prism in such a posture that its Axis might be perpendicular to that beam. Then I looked through the Prism upon the <23> hole, and turning the Prism to and fro about its Axis to make the Image of the hole ascend and descend, when between its two contrary Motions it seemed stationary, I stopt the Prism that the Refractions of both sides of the refracting Angle might be equal to each other as in the former Experiment. In this situation of the Prism viewing through it the said hole, I observed the length of its refracted Image to be many times greater than its breadth, and that the most refracted part thereof appeared violet, the least refracted red, the middle parts blew green and yellow in order. The same thing happened when I removed the Prism out of the Sun's Light, and looked through it upon the hole shining by the Light of the Clouds beyond it. And yet if the Refraction were done regularly according to one certain Proportion of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction as is vulgarly supposed, the refracted Image ought to have appeared round.
So then, by these two Experiments it appears that in equal Incidences there is a considerable inequality of Refractions : But whence this inequality arises, whether it be that some of the incident Rays are refracted more and others less, constantly or by chance, or that one and the same Ray is by Refraction disturbed, shattered, dilated, and as it were split and spread into many diverging Rays, as Grimaldo supposes, does not yet appear by these Experiments, but will appear by those that follow.
Exper. 5. Considering therefore, that if in the third Experiment the Image of the Sun should be drawn out into an oblong form, either by a Dilatation of every Ray, or by any other casual inequality of the Refractions, the same oblong Image would by a second Refraction made sideways be drawn out as much in breadth by the like Dilatation of the Rays or other casual inequality of the Re <24> fractions sideways, I tried what would be the Effects of such a second Refraction. For this end I ordered all things as in the third Experiment, and then placed a second Prism immediately after the first in a cross Position to it, that it might again refract the beam of the Sun's Light which came to it through the first Prism. In the first Prism this beam was refracted upwards, and in the second sideways. And I found that by the Refraction of the second Prism the breadth of the Image was not increased, but its superior part which in the first Prism suffered the greater Refraction and appeared violet and blew, did again in the second Prism suffer a greater Refraction than its inferior part, which appeared red and yellow , and this without any Dilatation of the Image in breadth.
Illustration. Let S represent the Sun,[Image 16] F the hole in the Window, ABC the first Prism, DH the second Prism, Y the round Image of the Sun made by a direct beam of Light when the Prisms are taken away, PT the oblong Image of the Sun made by that beam passing through the first Prism alone when the second Prism is taken away, and pt the Image made by the cross Refractions of both Prisms together. Now if the Rays which tend towards the several Points of the round Image Y were dilated and spread by the Refraction of the first Prism, so that they should not any longer go in single Lines to single Points, but that every Ray being split, shattered, and changed from a Linear Ray to a Superficies of Rays diverging from the Point of Refraction, and lying in the Plane of the Angles of Incidence and Refraction, they should go in those Planes to so many Lines reaching almost from one end of the Image PT to the other, and if that Image should thence become oblong : those Rays and their several parts tending towards the several Points of <25> the Image PT ought to be again dilated and spread Sideways by the transverse Refraction of the second Prism, so as to compose a foursquare Image, such as is represented at ττ. For the better understanding of which, let the Image PT be distinguished into five equal parts PQK, KQRL, LRSM, MSVN, NVT. And by the same irregularity that the Orbicular Light Y is by the Refraction of the first Prism dilated and drawn out into a long Image PT, the Light PQK which takes up a space of the same length and breadth with the Light Y ought to be by the Refraction of the second Prism dilated and drawn out into the long Image πqkp, and the Light KQRL into the long Image kqrl, and the Lights LRSM, MSVN, NVT, into so many other long Images lrsm, msvn, nvtτ; and all these long Images would compose the foursquare Image πτ. Thus it ought to be were every Ray dilated by Refraction, and spread into a triangular Superficies of Rays diverging from the Point of Refraction. For the second Refraction would spread the Rays one way as much as the first doth another, and so dilate the Image in breadth as much as the first doth in length. Amd the same thing ought to happen, were some Rays casually refracted more than others. But the Event is otherwise. The Image PT was not made broader by the Refraction of the second Prism, but only became oblique, as 'tis represented at pt, its upper end P being by the Refraction translated to a greater distance than its lower end T. So then the Light which went towards the upper end P of the Image, was (at equal Incidences) more refracted in the second Prism than the Light which tended towards the lower end T, that is the blew and violet, than the red and yellow; and therefore was more refrangible. The same Light was by the Refraction of the first Prism translated further from the <26> place Y to which it tended before Refraction; and therefore suffered as well in the first Prism as in the second a greater Refraction than the rest of the Light, and by consequence was more Refrangible than the rest, even before its incidence on the first Prism.
Sometimes I placed a third Prism after the second, and sometimes also a fourth after the third, by all which the Image might be often refracted sideways: but the Rays which were more refracted than the rest in the first Prism were also more refracted in all the rest, and that without any Dilatation of the Image sideways: and therefore those Rays for their constancy of a greater Refraction are deservedly reputed more Refrangible.
But that the meaning of this Experiment may more clearly appear,[Image 17] it is to be considered that the Rays which are equally Refrangible do fall upon a circle answering to the Sun's Disque. For this was proved in the third Experiment. By a circle I understand not here a perfect Geometrical Circle, but any Orbicular Figure whose length is equal to its breadth, and which, as to sense, may seem circular. Let therefore AG represent the circle which all the most Refrangible Rays propagated from the whole Disque of the Sun, would illuminate and paint upon the opposite Wall if they were alone; EL the circle which all the least Refrangible Rays would in like manner illuminate and paint if they were alone; BH, CJ, DK, the circles which so many intermediate sorts of Rays would successively paint upon the Wall, if they were singly propagated from the Sun in successive Order, the rest being always intercepted; And conceive that there are other intermediate Circles without number which innumerable other intermediate sorts of Rays would successively paint upon the Wall if the Sun should successively {emit every} sort apart. <27> And seeing the Sun emits all these sorts at once, they must all together illuminate and paint innumerable equal circles, of all which, being according to their degrees of Refrangibility placed in order in a continual series, that oblong Spectrum PT is composed which I described in the third Experiment. Now if the Sun's circular Image Y which is made by an unrefracted beam of Light was by any dilation of the single Rays, or by any other irregularity in the Refraction of the first Prism, converted into the Oblong Spectrum, PT: then ought every Circle AG, BH, CJ, &c. in that Spectrum, by the cross Refraction of the second Prism again dilating or otherwise scattering the Rays as before, to be in like manner drawn out and transformed into an Oblong Figure, and thereby the breadth of the Image PT would be now as much augmented as the length of the Image Y was before by the Refraction of the first Prism; and thus by the Refractions of both Prisms together would be formed a foursquare Figure pπtτ as I described above. Wherefore since the breadth of the Spectrum PT is not increased by the Refraction sideways, it is certain that the Rays are not split or dilated, or otherways irregularly scattered by that Refraction, but that every circle is by a regular and uniform Refraction translated entire into another place, as the circle AG by the greatest Refraction into the place ag, the circle BH by a less Refraction into the place bh, the circle CJ by a Refraction still less into the place ci, and so of the rest; by which means a new Spectrum pt inclined to the former PT is in like manner composed of circles lying in a right Line; and these circles must be of the same bigness with the former, because the breadths of all the Spectrums Y, PT and pt at equal distances from the Prisms are equal.
<28>
I considered further that by the breadth of the hole F through which the Light enters into the Dark Chamber, there is a Penumbra made in the circuit of the Spectrum Y, and that Penumbra remains in the rectilinear Sides of the Spectrums PT and pt. I placed therefore at that hole a Lens or Object-glass of a Telescope which might cast the Image of the Sun distinctly on Y without any Penumbra at all, and found that the Penumbra of the Rectilinear Sides of the oblong Spectrums PT and pt was also thereby taken away, so that those Sides appeared as distinctly defined as did the Circumference of the first Image Y. Thus it happens if the Glass of the Prisms be free from veins, atd their sides be accurately plane and well polished without those numberless waves or curles which usually arise from Sand-holes a little smoothed in polishing with Putty. If the Glass be only well polished and free from veins and the Sides not accurately plane but a little Convex or Concave, as it frequently happens; yet may the three Spectrums Y, PT and pt want Penumbras, but not in equal distances from the Prisms. Now from this want of Penumbras, I knew more certainly that every one of the circles was refracted according to some most regular, uniform, and constant Law. For if there were any irregularity in the Refraction, the right Lines AE and GL which all the circles in the Spectrum PT do touch, could not by that Refraction be translated into the Lines ae and gl as distinct and straight as they were before, but there would arise in those translated Lines some Penumbra or crookedness or undulation, or other sensible Perturbation contrary to what is found by Experience. Whatsoever Penumbra or Perturbation should be made in the circles by the cross Refraction of the second Prism, all that Penumbra or Perturbation would be conspicuous in <29> the right Lines ae and gl which touch those circles. And therefore since there is no such Penumbra or Perturbation in those right Lines there must be none in the circles. Since the distance between those Tangents or breadth of the Spectrum is not increased by the Refractions, the Diameters of the circles are not increased thereby. Since those Tangents continue to be right Lines, every circle which in the first Prism is more or less refracted, is exactly in the same Proportion more or less refracted in the second. And seeing all these things continue to succeed after the same manner when the Rays are again in a third Prism, and again in a fourth refracted Sideways, it is evident that the Rays of one and the same circle as to their degree of Refrangibility continue always Uniform and Homogeneal to one another, and that those of several circles do differ in degree of Refrangibility, and that in some certain and constant Proportion. Which is the thing I was to prove.
There is yet another Circumstance or two of this Experiment by which it becomes still more plain and convincing.[Image 18] Let the second Prism DH be placed not immediately after the first, but at some distance from it; Suppose in the mid-way between it and the Wall on which the oblong Spectrum PT is cast, so that the Light from the first Prism may fall upon it in the form of an oblong Spectrum pπtτ Parallel to this second Prism, and be refracted Sideways to form the oblong Spectrum pt upon the Wall. And you will find as before, that this Spectrum pt is inclined to that Spectrum PT, which the first Prism forms alone without the second; the blew ends P and p being further distant from one another than the red ones T and t, and by consequence that the Rays which go to the blew end π of the Image πτ and which therefore suffer the greatest Refraction in the first Prism, are again in the second Prism more refracted than the rest.
<30>
The same thing I try'd also by letting the Sun's Light into a dark Room through two little round holes F and φ made in the Window,[Image 19] and with two Parallel Prisms ABC and αβγ placed at those holes (one at each) refracting those two beams of Light to the opposite Wall of the Chamber, in such manner that the two colour'd Images PT and mn which they there painted were joyned end to end and lay in one straight Line, the red end T of the one touching the blew end m of the other. For if these two refracted beams were again by a third Prism DH placed cross to the two first, refracted Sideways, and the Spectrums thereby translated to some other part of the Wall of the Chamber, suppose the Spectrum PT to pt and the Spectrum MN to mn, these translated Spectrums pt and mn would not lie in one straight Line with their ends contiguous as before, but be broken off from one another and become Parallel, the blew end of the Image mn being by a greater Refraction translated farther from its former place MT, than the red end t of the other Image pt from the same place MT which puts the Proposition past dispute. And this happens whether the third Prism DH be placed immediately after the two first or at a great distance from them, so that the Light refracted in the two first Prisms be either white and circular, or coloured and oblong when it falls on the third.
Exper. 6. In the middle of two thin Boards I made round holes a third part of an Inch in Diameter, and in the Window-shut a much broader hole, being made to let into my darkned Chamber a large beam of the Sun's Light; I placed a Prism behind the Shut in that beam to refract it towards the opposite Wall, and close behind the Prism I fixed one of the Boards, in such manner that the middle of the refracted Light might {pass} through the hole <31> made in it, and the rest be intercepted by the Board. Then at the distance of about twelve Feet from the first Board I fixed the other Board, in such manner that the middle of the refracted Light which came through the hole in the first Board and fell upon the opposite Wall might pass through the hole in this other Board, and the rest being intercepted by the Board might paint upon it the coloured Spectrum of the Sun. And close behind this Board I fixed another Prism to refract the Light which came through the hole. Then I returned speedily to the first Prism, and by turning it slowly to and fro about its Axis, I caused the Image which fell upon the second Board to move up and down upon that Board, that all its parts might successively pass through the hole in that Board and fall upon the Prism behind it. And in the mean time, I noted the places on the opposite Wall to which that Light after its Refraction in the second Prism did pass; and by the difference of the places I found that the Light which being most refracted in the first Prism did go to the blew end of the Image, was again more refracted in the second Prism than the Light which went to the red end of that Image, which proves as well the first Proposition as the second. And this happened whether the Axis of the two Prisms were parallel, or inclined to one another and to the Horizon in any given Angles.
Illustration.[Image 20] Let F be the wide hole in the Window-shut, through which the Sun shines upon the first Prism ABC, and let the refracted Light fall upon the middle of the Board DE, and the middle part of that Light upon the hole G made in the middle part of that Board. Let this trajected part of that Light fall again upon the middle of the second Board de, and there paint such an oblong coloured Image of the Sun as was described in the third Experiment. <32> By turning the Prism ABC slowly to and fro about its Axis this Image will be made to move up and down the Board de, and by this means all its parts from one end to the other may be made to pass successively through the hole g which is made in the middle of that Board. In the mean while another Prism abc is to be fixed next after that hole g to refract the trajected Light a second time. And these things being thus ordered, I marked the places M and N of the opposite Wall upon which the refracted Light fell, and found that whilst the two Boards and second Prism remained unmoved, those places by turning the first Prism about its Axis were changed perpetually. For when the lower part of the Light which fell upon the second Board de was cast through the hole g it went to a lower place M on the Wall, and when the higher part of that Light was cast thrbugh the same hole g, it went to a higher place N on the Wall, and when any intermediate part of the Light was cast through that hole it went to some place on the Wall between M and N. The unchanged Position of the holes in the Boards, made the Incidence of the Rays upon the second Prism to be the same in all cases. And yet in that common Incidence some of the Rays were more refracted and others less. And those were more refracted in this Prism which by a greater Refraction in the first Prism were more turned out of the way, and therefore for their constancy of being more refracted are deservedly called more Refrangible.
Exper. 7. At two holes made near one another in my Window-shut I placed two Prisms, one at each, which might cast upon the opposite Wall (after the manner of the third Experiment) two oblong coloured Images of the Sun. And at a little distance from the Wall I placed a long slender Paper with straight and parallel edges, and <33> ordered the Prisms and Paper so, that the red Colour of one Image might fall directly upon one half of the Paper, and the violet colour of the other Image upon the other half of the same Paper; so that the Paper appeared of two Colours, red and violet, much after the manner of the painted Paper in the first and second Experiments. Then with a black Cloth I covered the Wall behind the Paper, that no Light might be reflected from it to disturb the Experiment, and viewing the Paper through a third Prism held parallel to it, I saw that half of it which was illuminated by the violet-Light to be divided from the other half by a greater Refraction, especially when I went a good way off from the Paper. For when I viewed it too near at hand, the two halfs of the Paper did not appear fully divided from one another, but seemed contiguous at one of their Angles like the painted Paper in the first Experiment. Which also happened when the Paper was too broad.
Sometimes instead of the Paper I used a white Thred, and this appeared through the Prism divided into two Parallel Threds as is represented in the 19th Figure,[Image 21] where DG denotes the Thred illuminated with violet Light from D to E and with red Light from F to G, and de fg are the parts of the Thred seen by Refraction. If one half of the Thred be constantly illuminated with red, and the other half be illuminated with all the Colours successively, (which may be done by causing one of the Prisms to be turned about its Axis whilst the other remains unmoved) this other half in viewing the Thred through the Prism, will appear in a continued right Line with the first half when illuminated with red, and begin to be a little divided from it when illuminated with Orange, and remove further from it when illuminated with Yellow, and still <34> further when with Green, and further when with Blew, and go yet further off when illuminated with Indigo, and furthest when with deep Violet. Which plainly shews, that the Lights of several Colours are more and more Refrangible one than another, in this order of their Colours, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blew, Indigo, deep Violet; and so proves as well the first Proposition as the second.
I caused also the coloured Spectrums PT and MN made in a dark Chamber by the Refractions of two Prisms to lye in a right Line end to end,[Image 22] as was described above in the fifth Experiment, and viewing them through a third Prism held Parallel to their Length, they appeared no longer in a right Line, but became broken from one another, as they are represented at pt and mn, the violet end m of the Spectrum mn being by a greater Refraction translated further from its former Place MT than the red end t of the other Spectrum pt.
I further caused those two Spectrums PT and MN to become co-incident in an inverted order of their Colours,[Image 23] the red end of each falling on the violet end of the other, as they are represented in the oblong Figure PTMN; and then viewing them through a Prism DH held Parallel to their length, they appeared not co-incident as when viewed with the naked Eye, but in the form of two distinct Spectrums pt and mn crossing one another in the middle after the manner of the letter X. Which shews that the red of the one Spectrum and violet of the other, which were co-incident at PN and MT, being parted from one another by a greater Refraction of the violet to p and m than of the red to n and t, do differ in degrees of Refrangibility.
I illuminated also a little circular piece of white Paper all over with the Lights of both Prisms intermixed, and <35> when it was illuminated with the red of one Spectrum and deep violet of the other, so as by the mixture of those Colours to appear all over purple, I viewed the Paper, first at a less distance, and then at a greater, through a third Prism; and as I went from the Paper, the refracted Image thereof became more and more divided by the unequal Refraction of the two mixed Colours, and at length parted into two distinct Images, a red one and a violet one, whereof the violet was furthest from the Paper, and therefore suffered the greatest Refraction. And when that Prism at the Window which cast the violet on the Paper was taken away, the violet Image disappeared; but when the other Prism was taken away the red vanished: which shews that these two Images were nothing else than the Lights of the two Prisms which had been intermixed on the purple Paper, but were parted again by their unequal Refractions made in the third Prism through which the Paper was viewed. This also was observable that if one of the Prisms at the Window, suppose that which cast the violet on the Paper, was turned about its Axis to make all the Colours in this order, Violet, Indigo, Blew, Green, Yellow, Orange, Red, fall successively on the Paper from that Prism, the violet Image changed Colour accordingly, and in changing Colour came nearer and nearer to the red one, until when it was also red they both became fully co-incident.
I placed also two Paper circles very near one another, the one in the red Light of one Prism, and the other in the violet Light of the other. The circles were each of them an Inch in diameter, and behind them the Wall was dark that the Experiment might not be disturbed by any Light coming from thence. These circles thus illuminated, I viewed through a Prism so held that the Refraction might be made towards the red circle, and as I went from them <36> they came nearer and nearer together, and at length became co-incident; and afterwards when I went still further off, they parted again in a contrary order, the violet by a greater Refraction being carried beyond the red.
Exper. 8. In Summer when the Sun's Light uses to be strongest, I placed a Prism at the hole of the Window-shut, as in the third Experiment, yet so that its Axis might be Parallel to the Axis of the World, and at the opposite Wall in the Sun's refracted Light, I placed an open Book. Then going Six Feet and tvvo Inches from the Book, I placed there the abovementioned Lens, by vvhich the Light reflected from the Book might be made to converge and meet again at the distance of six Feet and tvvo Inches behind the Lens, and there paint the Species of the Book upon a sheet of vvhite Paper much after the manner of the second Experiment. The Book and Lens being made fast, I noted the place vvhere the Paper vvas, vvhen the Letters of the Book, illuminated by the fullest red Light of the solar Image falling upon it, did cast their Species on that Paper most distinctly; And then I stay'd till by the Motion of the Sun and consequent Motion of his Image on the Book, all the Colours from that red to the middle of the blew pass'd over those Letters; and when those Letters were illuminated by that blew, I noted again the place of the Paper when they cast their Species most distinctly upon it: And I found that this last place of the Paper was nearer to the Lens than its former place by about two Inches and an half, or two and three quarters. So much sooner therefore did the Light in the violet end of the Image by a greater Refraction converge and meet, than the Light in the red end. But in trying this the Chamber was as dark as I could make it. For if these Colours be diluted and weakned by the mixture of any adventitious Light, the distance <37> between the places of the Paper will not be so great. This distance in the second Experiment where the Colours of natural Bodies were made use of, was but an Inch and an half, by reason of the imperfection of those Colours. Here in the Colours of the Prism, which are manifestly more full, intense, and lively than those of natural Bodies, the distance is two Inches and three quarters. And were the Colours still more full, I question not but that the distance would be considerably greater. For the coloured Light of the Prism, by the interfering of the Circles described in the 11th Figure of the fifth Experiment, and also by the Light of the very bright Clouds next the Sun's Body intermixing with these Colours, and by the Light scattered by the inequalities in the polish of the Prism, was so very much compounded, that the Species which those faint and dark Colours, the Indigo and Violet, cast upon the Paper were not distinct enough to be well observed.
Exper. 9. A Prism, whose two Angles at its Base were equal to one another and half right ones, and the third a right one, I placed in a beam of the Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through a hole in the Window-shut as in the third Experiment. And turning the Prism slowly about its Axis until all the Light which went through one of its Angles and was refracted by it began to be reflected by its Base, at which till then it went out of the Glass, I observed that those Rays which had suffered the greatest Refraction were sooner reflected than the rest. I conceived therefore that those Rays of the reflected Light, which were most Refrangible, did first of all by a total Reflexion become more copious in that Light than the rest, and that afterwards the rest also, by a total Reflexion, became as copious as these. To try this, I made the reflected Light pass through another Prism, and being refra <38> cted by it to fall afterwards upon a sheet of white Paper placed at some distance behind it, and there by that Refraction to paint the usual Colours of the Prism. And then causing the first Prism to be turned about its Axis as above, I observed that when those Rays which in this Prism had suffered the greatest Refraction and appeared of a blew and violet Colour began to be totally reflected, the blew and violet Light on the Paper which was most refracted in the second Prism received a sensible increase above that of the red and yellow, which was least refracted; and afterwards when the rest of the Light which was green, yellow and red began to be totally reflected in the first Prism, the Light of those Colours on the Paper received as great an increase as the violet and blew had done before. Whence 'tis manifest, that the beam of Light reflected by the Base of the Prism, being augmented first by the more Refrangible Rays and afterwards by the less Refrangible ones, is compounded of Rays differently Refrangible. And that all such reflected Light is of the same Nature with the Sun's Light, before its Incidence on the Base of the Prism, no Man ever doubted: it being generally allowed, that Light by such Reflexions suffers no Alteration in its Modifications and Properties. I do not here take notice of any Refractions made in the Sides of the first Prism, because the Light enters it perpendicularly at the first Side, and goes out perpendicularly at the second Side, and therefore suffers none. So then, the Sun's incident Light being of the same temper and constitution with his emergent Light, and the last being compounded of Rays differently Refrangible, the first must be in like manner compounded.
Illustration. In the 21th Figure,[Image 24] ABC is the first Prism, BC its Base, B and C its equal Angles at the Base, each <39> of 45 degrees, A its Rectangular Vertex, FM a beam of the Sun's Light let into a dark Room through a hole F one third part of an Inch broad, M its Incidence on the Base of the Prism, MG a less refracted Ray, MH a more refracted Ray, MN the beam of Light reflected from the Base, VXY the second Prism by which this beam in passing through it is refracted, Nt the less refracted Light of this beam, and Np the more refracted part thereof. When the first Prism ABC is turned about its Axis according to the order of the Letters ABC, the Rays MH emerge more and more obliquely out of that Prism, and at length after their most oblique Emergence are reflected towards N, and going on to p do increase the number of the Rays Np. Aftervvards by continuing the motion of the first Prism, the Rays MG are also reflected to N and increase the number of the Rays Nt. And therefore the Light MN admits into its Composition, first the more Refrangible Rays, and then the less Refrangible Rays, and yet after this Composition is of the same Nature vvith the Sun's immediate Light FM, the Reflexion of the specular Base BC causing no Alteration therein.
Exper. 10. Two Prisms, which were alike in shape, I tied so together, that their Axes and opposite Sides being Parallel, they composed a Parallelopiped. And, the Sun shining into my dark Chamber through a little hole in the Window-shut, I placed that Parallelopiped in his beam at some distance from the hole, in such a posture that the Axes of the Prisms might be perpendicular to the incident Rays, and that those Rays being incident upon the first Side of one Prism, might go on through the two contiguous Sides of both Prisms, and emerge out of the last Side of the second Prism. This Side being Parallel to the first Side of the first Prism, caused the emerging Light to be Parallel <40> to the incident. Then, beyond these two Prisms I placed a third, which might refract that emergent Light, and by that Refraction cast the usual Colours of the Prism upon the opposite Wall, or upon a sheet of white Paper held at a convenient distance behind the Prism for that refracted Light to fall upon it. After this I turned the Parallelopiped about its Axis, and found that when the contiguous Sides of the two Prisms became so oblique to the incident Rays that those Rays began all of them to be reflected, those Rays which in the third Prism had suffered the greatest Refraction and painted the Paper with violet and blew, were first of all by a total Reflexion taken out of the transmitted Light, the rest remaining and on the Paper painting their Colours of Green, Yellow, Orange, and Red as before; and afterwards by continuing the motion of the two Prisms, the rest of the Rays also by a total Reflexion vanished in order, according to their degrees of Refrangibility. The Light therefore which emerged out of the two Prisms is compounded of Rays differently Refrangible, seeing the more Refrangible Rays may be taken out of it while the less Refrangible remain. But this Light being trajected only through the Parallel Superficies of the two Prisms, if it suffered any change by the Refraction of one Superficies it lost that impression by the contrary Refraction of the other Superficies, and so being restored to its pristine constitution became of the same nature and condition as at first before its Incidence on those Prisms; and therefore, before its Incidence, was as much compounded of Rays differently Refrangible as afterwards.
Illustration. In the 22th Figure[Image 25] ABC and BCD are the two Prisms tied together in the form of a Parallelopiped, their Sides BC and CB being contiguous, and their Sides AB and CD Parallel. And HJK is the third <41> Prism, by which the Sun's Light propagated through the hole F into the dark Chamber, and there passing through those sides of the Prisms AB, BC, CB and CD, is refracted at O to the white Paper PT, falling there partly upon P by a greater Refraction, partly upon T by a less Refraction, and partly upon R and other intermediate places by intermediate Refractions. By turning the Parallelopiped ACBD about its Axis, according to the order of the Letters A, C, D, B, at length when the contiguous Planes BC and CB become sufficiently oblique to the Rays FM, which are incident upon them at M, there will vanish totally out of the refracted Light OPT, first of all the most refracted Rays OP, (the rest OR and OT remaining as before) then the Rays OR and other intermediate ones, and lastly, the least refracted Rays OT. For when the Plane BC becomes sufficiently oblique to the Rays incident upon it, those Rays will begin to be totally reflected by it towards N; and first the most Refrangible Rays will be totally reflected (as was explained in the preceding experiment) and by consequence must first disappear at P, and afterwards the rest as they are in order totally reflected to N, they must disappear in the same order at R and T. So then the Rays which at O suffer the greatest Refraction, may be taken out of the Light MO whilst the rest of the Rays remain in it, and therefore that Light MO is Compounded of Rays differently Refrangible. And because the Planes AB and CD are parallel, and therefore by equal and contrary Refractions destroy one anothers Effects, the incident Light FM must be of the same kind and nature with the emergent Light MO, and therefore doth also consist of Rays differently Refrangible. These two Lights FM and MO, before the most refrangible Rays are separated out of the emergent Light MO agree in Co <42> lour, and in all other properties so far as my observation reaches, and therefore are deservedly reputed of the same Nature and Constitution, and by consequence the one is compounded as well as the other. But after the most Refrangible Rays begin to be totally reflected, and thereby separated out of the emergent Light MO, that Light changes its Colour from white to a dilute and faint yellow, a pretty good orange, a very full red successively and then totally vanishes. For after the most Refrangible Rays which paint the Paper at P with a Purple Colour, are by a total reflexion taken out of the Beam of Light MO, the rest of the Colours which appear on the Paper at R and T being mixed in the Light MO compound there a faint yellow, and after the blue and part of the green which appear on the Paper between P and R are taken away, the rest which appear between R and T (that is the Yellow, Orange, Red and a little Green) being mixed in the beam MO compound there an Orange; and when all the Rays are by reflexion taken out of the Beam MO, except the least Refrangible, which at T appear of a full Red, their Colour is the same in that Beam MO as afterwards at T, the Refraction of the Prism HJK serving only to separate the differently Refrangible Rays, without making any alteration in their Colours, as shall be more fully proved hereafter. All which confirms as well the first Proposition as the second.
Scholium. If this Experiment and the former be conjoyned and made one,[Image 26] by applying a fourth Prism VXY to refract the reflected Beam MN towards tp, the conclusion will be clearer. For then the Light Np which in the 4th Prism is more refracted, will become fuller and stronger when the Light OP, which in the third Prism HJK is more refracted, vanishes at P; and afterwards when the less <43> refracted Light OT vanishes at T, the less refracted Light Nt will become encreased whilst the more refracted Light at p receives no further encrease. And as the trajected Beam MO in vanishing is always of such a Colour as ought to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the Paper PT, so is the reflected Beam MN always of such a Colour as ought to result from the mixture of the Colours which fall upon the Paper pt. For when the most refrangible Rays are by a total Reflexion taken out of the Beam MO, and leave that Beam of an Orange Colour, the excess of those Rays in the reflected Light, does not only make the Violet, Indigo and Blue at p more full, but also makes the Beam MN change from the yellowish Colour of the Sun's Light, to a pale white inclining to blue, and afterward recover its yellowish Colour again, so soon as all the rest of the transmitted light MOT is reflected.
Now seeing that in all this variety of Experiments, whether the trial be made in Light reflected, and that either from natural Bodies, as in the first and second Experiment, or Specular, as in the Ninth; or in Light refracted, and that either before the unequally refracted Rays are by diverging separated from one another, and losing their whiteness which they have altogether, appear severally of several Colours, as in the fifth Experiment; or after they are separated from one another, and appear Coloured as in the sixth, seventh, and eighth Experiments; or in Light trajected through Parallel superficies, destroying each others Effects, as in the 10th Experiment; there are always found Rays, which at equal Incidences on the same Medium suffer unequal Refractions, and that without any splitting or dilating of single Rays, or contingence in the inequality of the Refractions, as is proved in the fifth and sixth Ex <44> periments; and seeing the Rays which differ in Refrangibility may be parted and sorted from one another, and that either by Refraction as in the third Experiment, or by Reflexion as in the tenth, and then the several sorts apart at equal Incidences suffer unequal Refractions, and those sorts are more refracted than others after separation, which were more refracted before it, as in the sixth and following Experiments, and if the Sun's Light be trajected through three or more cross Prisms successively, those Rays which in the first Prism are refracted more than others are in all the following Prisms refracted more then others in the same rate and proportion, as appears by the fifth Experiment; it's manifest that the Sun's Light is an Heterogeneous mixture of Rays, some of which are constantly more refrangible then others, as was proposed.
PROP. III. Theor. III.
The Sun's Light consists of Rays differing in Reflexibility, and those Rays are more Reflexible than others which are more Refrangible.
THIS is manifest by the ninth and tenth Experiments: For in the ninth Experiment, by turning the Prism about its Axis, until the Rays within it which in going out into the Air were refracted by its Base, became so oblique to that Base, as to begin to be totally reflected thereby; those Rays became first of all totally reflected which before at equal Incidences with the rest had suffered the greatest Refraction. And the same thing happens in the Reflexion made by the common Base of the two Prisms in the tenth Experiment.
<45>
PROP. IV. Prob. I.
To separate from one another the Heterogeneous Rays of compound Light.
THE Heterogeneous Rays are in some measure separated from one another by the Refraction of the Prism in the third Experiment, and in the fifth Experiment by taking away the Penumbra from the Rectilinear sides of the Coloured Image, that separation in those very Rectilinear sides or straight edges of the Image becomes perfect. But in all places between those rectilinear edges, those innumerable Circles there described, which are severally illuminated by Homogeneal Rays, by interfering with one another, and being every where commixt, do render the Light sufficiently Compound. But if these Circles, whilst their Centers keep their distances and positions, could be made less in Diameter, their interfering one with another and by consequence the mixture of the Heterogeneous Rays would be proportionally diminished. In the 23rd Figure[Image 27] let AG, BH, CJ, DK, EL, FM be the Circles which so many sorts of Rays flowing from the same Disque of the Sun, do in the third Experiment illuminate; of all which and innumerable other intermediate ones lying in a continual Series between the two Rectilinear and Parallel edges of the Sun's oblong Image PT, that Image is composed as was explained in the fifth Experiment. And let ag, bh, ci, dk, el, fm be so many less Circles lying in a like continual Series between two Parallel right Lines af and gm with the same distances between their Centers, and illuminated by the same sorts of Rays, that is the Circle ag with the same sort by which the corresponding <46> Circle AG was illuminated, and the Circle bh with the same sort by which the corresponding Circle BH was illuminated, and the rest of the Circles ci, dk, el, fm respectively, with the same sorts of Rays by which the several corresponding Circles CJ, DK, EL, FM were illuminated. In the Figure PT composed of the greater Circles, three of those Circles AG, BH, CJ, are so expanded into one another, that the three sorts of Rays by which those Circles are illuminated, together with other innumerable sorts of intermediate Rays, are mixed at QR in the middle of the Circle BH. And the like mixture happens throughout almost the whole length of the Figure PT. But in the Figure pt composed of the less Circles, the three less Circles ag, bh, ci, which answer to those three greater, do not extend into one another; nor are there any where mingled so much as any two of the three sorts of Rays by which those Circles are illuminated, and which in the Figure PT are all of them intermingled at BH.
Now he that shall thus consider it, will easily understand that the mixture is diminished in the same Proportion with the Diameters of the Circles. If the Diameters of the Circles whilst their Centers remain the same, be made three times less than before, the mixture will be also three times less; if ten times less, the mixture will be ten times less, and so of other Proportions. That is, the mixture of the Rays in the greater Figure PT will be to their mixture in the less pt, as the Latitude of the greater Figure is to the Latitude of the less. For the Latitudes of these Figures are equal to the Diameters of their Circles. And hence it easily follows, that the mixture of the Rays in the refracted Spectrum pt is to the mixture of the Rays in the direct and immediate Light of the Sun, as the breadth of that Spectrum is to the difference between the length and breadth of the same Spectrum.
<47>
So then, if we would diminish the mixture of the Rays, we are to diminish the Diameters of the Circles. Now these would be diminished if the Sun's Diameter to which they answer could be made less than it is, or (which comes to the same purpose) if without Doors, at a great distance from the Prism towards the Sun, some opake Body were placed, with a round hole in the middle of it, to intercept all the Sun's Light, excepting so much as coming from the middle of his Body could pass through that hole to the Prism. For so the Circles AG, BH and the rest, would not any longer answer to the whole Disque of the Sun, but only to that part of it which could be seen from the Prism through that hole, that it is to the apparent magnitude of that hole viewed from the Prism. But that these Circles may answer more distinctly to that hole a Lens is to be placed by the Prism to cast the Image of the hole, (that is, every one of the Circles AG, BH, &c.) distinctly upon the Paper at PT, after such a manner as by a Lens placed at a Window the Species of Objects abroad are cast distinctly upon a Paper within the Room, and the Rectilinear Sides of the oblong solar Image in the fifth Experiment became distinct without any Penumbra. If this be done it will not be necessary to place that hole very far off, no not beyond the Window. And therefore instead of that hole, I used the hole in the Window-shut as follows.
Exper. 11. In the Sun's Light let into my darkned Chamber through a small round hole in my Window-shut, at about 10 or 12 Feet from the Window, I placed a Lens, by which the Image of the hole might be distinctly cast upon a Sheet of white Paper, placed at the distance of six, eight, ten or twelve Feet from the Lens. For according to the difference of the Lenses I used various <48> distances, which I think not worth the while to describe. Then immediately after the Lens I placed a Prism, by which the trajected Light might be refracted either upwards or sideways, and thereby the round Image which the Lens alone did cast upon the Paper might be drawn out into a long one with Parallel Sides, as in the third Experiment. This oblong Image I let fall upon another Paper at about the same distance from the Prism as before, moving the Paper either towards the Prism or from it, until I found the just distance where the Rectilinear Sides of the Image became most distinct. For in this case the circular Images of the hole which compose that Image after the same manner that the Circles ag, bh, ci, &c. do the Figure pt,[Image 28] were terminated most distinctly without any Penumbra, and therefore extended into one another the least that they could, and by consequence the mixture of the Heterogeneous Rays was now the least of all. By this means I used to form an oblong Image[Image 29] (such as is pt) of circular Images of the hole (such as are ag, bh, ci, &c.) and by using a greater or less hole in the Window-shut, I made the circular Images ag, bh, ci, &c. of which it was formed, to become greater or less at pleasure, and thereby the mixture of the Rays in the Image pt to be as much or as little as I desired.
Illustration. In the 24th Figure,[Image 30] F represents the circular hole in the Window-shut, MN the Lens whereby the Image or Species of that hole is cast distinctly upon a Paper at J, ABC the Prism whereby the Rays are at their emerging out of the Lens refracted from J towards another Paper at pt, and the round Image at J is turned into an oblong Image pt falling on that other Paper. This Image pt consists of Circles placed one after another in a Rectilinear order, as was sufficiently explained in the fifth <49> Experiment; and these Circles are equal to the Circle I, and consequently answer in magnitude to the hole F; and therefore by diminishing that hole they may be at pleasure diminished, whil'st their Centers remain in their places. By this means I made the breadth of the Image pt to be forty times, and sometimes sixty or seventy times less than its length. As for instance, if the breadth of the hole F be  of an Inch, and MF the distance of the Lens from the hole be 12 Feet; and if pB or pM the distance of the Image pt from the Prism or Lens be 10 Feet, and the refracting Angle of the Prism be 62 Degrees, the breadth of the Image pt will be  of an Inch and the length about six Inches, and therefore the length to the breadth as 72 to 1, and by consequence the Light of this Image 71 times less compound than the Sun's direct Light. And Light thus far Simple and Homogeneal, is sufficient for trying all the Experiments in this Book about simple Light. For the composition of Heterogeneal Rays is in this Light so little that it is scarce to be discovered and perceived by sense, except perhaps in the Indigo and Violet; for these being dark Colours, do easily suffer a sensible allay by that little scattering Light which uses to be refracted irregularly by the inequalities of the Prism.
Yet instead of the circular hole F, 'tis better to substitute an oblong hole shaped like a long Parallelogram with its length Parallel to the Prism ABC. For if this hole be an Inch or two long, and but a tenth or twentieth part of an Inch broad, or narrower: the Light of the Image pt will be as simple as before or simpler, and the Image will become much broader, and therefore more fit to have Experiments tried in its Light than before.
Instead of this Parallelogram-hole may be substituted a Triangular one of equal Sides, whose Base for instance is <50> about the tenth part of an Inch, and its height an Inch or more. For by this means, if the Axis of the Prism be Parallel to the Perpendicular of the Triangle, the Image pt will now be formed of Equicrural Triangles ag, bh, ci, dk, el, fm, &c.[Image 31] and innumerable other intermediate ones answering to the Triangular hole in shape and bigness, and lying one after another in a continual Series between two Parallel Lines af and gm. These Triangles are a little intermingled at their Bases but not at their Vertices, and therefore the Light on the brighter side af of the Image where the Bases of the Triangles are is a little compounded, but on the darker side gm is altogether uncompounded, and in all places between the sides the Composition is Proportional to the distances of the places from that obscurer side gm. And having a Spectrum pt of such a Composition, we may try Experiments either in its stronger and less simple Light near the side af, or in its weaker and simpler Light near the other side lm, as it shall seem most convenient.
But in making Experiments of this kind the Chamber ought to be made as dark as can be, lest any foreign Light mingle it self with the Light of the Spectrum pt, and render it compound; especially if we would try Experiments in the more simple Light next the side gm of the Spectrum; which being fainter, will have a less Proportion to the forreign Light; and so by the mixture of that Light be more troubled and made more compound. The Lens also ought to be good, such as may serve for Optical Uses, and the Prism ought to have a large Angle, suppose of 70 Degrees, and to be well wrought, being made of Glass free from Bubbles and Veins, with its sides not a little Convex or Concave as usually happens but truly plane, and its pollish elaborate, as in working Optick <51> glasses, and not such as is usually wrought with Putty, whereby the edges of the Sand-holes being worn away, there are left all over the Glass a numberless company of very little Convex polite risings like Waves. The edges also of the Prism and Lens so far as they may make any irregular Refraction, must be covered with a black Paper glewed on. And all the Light of the Sun's beam let into the Chamber which is useless and unprofitable to the Experiment, ought to be intercepted with black Paper or other black Obstacles. For otherwise the useless Light being reflected every way in the Chamber, will mix with the oblong Spectrum and help to disturb it. In trying these things so much diligence is not altogether necessary, but it will promote the success of the Experiments, and by a very scrupulous Examiner of things deserves to be applied. It's difficult to get Glass Prisms fit for this purpose, and therefore I used sometimes Prismatick Vessels made with pieces of broken Looking-glasses, and filled with rain Water. And to increase the Refraction, I sometimes impregnated the Water strongly with Saccharum Saturni.
PROP. V. Theor. IV.
Homogeneal Light is refracted regularly without any Dilatation splitting or shattering of the Rays, and the confused Vision of Objects seen through Refracting Bodies by Heterogeneal Light arises from the different Refrangibility of several sorts of Rays.
THE first Part of this Proposition has been already sufficiently proved in the fifth Experiment, and will further appear by the Experiments which follow.
<52>
Exper. 12. In the middle of a black Paper I made a round hole about a fifth or sixth part of an Inch in diameter. Upon this Paper I caused the Spectrum of Homogeneal Light described in the former Proposition, so to fall, that some part of the Light might pass through the hole of the Paper. This transmitted part of the Light I refracted with a Prism placed behind the Paper, and letting this refracted Light fall perpendicularly upon a white Paper two or three Feet distant from the Prism, I found that the Spectrum formed on the Paper by this Light was not oblong, as when 'tis made (in the third Experiment) by Refracting the Sun's compound Light, but was (so far as I could judge by my Eye) perfectly circular, the length being no greater than the breadth. Which shews that this Light is refracted regularly without any Dilatation of the Rays.
Exper. 13 In the Homogeneal Light I placed a Paper Circle  of an Inch in Diameter, and in the Sun's unrefracted Heterogeneal white Light I placed another Paper Circle of the same bigness. And going from the Papers to the distance of some Feet, I viewed both Circles through a Prism. The Circle illuminated by the Sun's Heterogeneal Light appeared very oblong as in the fourth Experiment, the length being many times greater than the breadth: but the other Circle illuminated with Homogeneal Light appeared Circular and distinctly defined as when 'tis viewed with the naked Eye. Which proves the whole Proposition.
Exper. 14. In the Homogeneal Light I placed Flies and such like Minute Objects, and viewing them through a Prism, I saw their Parts as distinctly defined as if I had viewed them with the naked Eye. The same Objects placed in the Sun's unrefracted Heterogeneal Light which was white I viewed also through a Prism, and saw them most <53> confusedly defined, so that I could not distinguish their smaller parts from one another. I placed also the Letters of a small Print one while in the Homogeneal Light and then in the Heterogeneal, and viewing them through a Prism, they appeared in the latter case so confused and indistinct that I could not read them; but in the former they appeared so distinct that I could read readily, and thought I saw them as distinct as when I viewed them with my naked Eye. In both cases I viewed the same Objects through the same Prism at the same distance from me and in the same Situation. There was no difference but in the Light by which the Objects were illuminated, and which in one case was Simple and in the other Compound, and therefore the distinct Vision in the former case and confused in the latter could arise from nothing else than from that difference of the Lights. Which proves the whole Proposition.
And in these three Experiments it is further very remarkable, that the Colour of Homogeneal Light was never changed by the Refraction.
PROP. VI. Theor. V.
The Sine of Incidence of every Ray considered apart, is to its Sine of Refraction in a given Ratio.
THAT every Ray considered apart is constant to it self in some degree of Refrangibility, is sufficiently manifest out of what has been said. Those Rays which in the first Refraction are at equal Incidences most refracted, are also in the following Refractions at equal Incidences most refracted; and so of the least Refrangible, and the rest which have any mean degree of <54> Refrangibility, as is manifest by the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th Experiments. And those which the first time at like Incidences are equally refracted, are again at like Incidences equally and uniformly refracted, and that whether they be refracted before they be separated from one another as in the 5th Experiment, or whether they be refracted apart, as in the 12th, 13th and 14th Experiments. The Refraction therefore of every Ray apart is regular, and what Rule that Refraction observes we are now to shew.
The late Writers in Opticks teach, that the Sines of Incidence are in a given Proportion to the Sines of Refraction, as was explained in the 5th Axiom; and some by Instruments fitted for measuring of Refractions, or otherwise experimentally examining this Proportion, do acquaint us that they have found it accurate. But whilst they, not understanding the different Refrangibility of several Rays, conceived them all to be refracted according to one and the same Proportion, 'tis to be presumed that they adapted their Measures only to the middle of the refracted Light; so that from their measures we may conclude only that the Rays which have a mean degree of Refrangibility, that is those which when separated from the rest appear green, are refracted according to a given Proportion of their Sines. Amd therefore we are now to shew that the like given Proportions obtain in all the rest. That it should be so is very reasonable, Nature being ever conformable to her self; but an experimental Proof is desired. And such a Proof will be had if we can shew that the Sines of Refraction of Rays differently Refrangible are one to another in a given Proportion when their Sines of Incidence are equal. For if the Sines of Refraction of all the Rays are in given Proportions to the Sine of Refraction <55> of a Ray which has a mean degree of Refrangibility, and this Sine is in a given Proportion to the equal Sines of Incidence, those other Sines of Refraction will also be in given Proportions to the equal Sines of Incidence. Now when the Sines of Incidence are equal, it will appear by the following Experiment that the Sines of Refraction are in a given Proportion to one another.
Exper. 15. The Sun shining into a dark Chamber through a little round hole in the Window-shut, let S represent his round white Image painted on the opposite Wall by his direct Light, PT his oblong coloured Image made by refracting that Light with a Prism placed at the Window;[Image 32] and pt, or 2p2t, 3p 3t, his oblong coloured Image made by refracting again the same Light sideways with a second Prism placed immediately after the first in a cross position to it, as was explained in the fifth Experiment; that is to say, pt when the Refraction of the second Prism is small, 2p 2t when its Refraction is greater, and 3p 3t when it is greatest. For such will be the diversity of the Refractions if the refracting Angle of the second Prism be of various Magnitudes; suppose of fifteen or twenty degrees to make the Image pt, of thirty or forty to make the Image 2p 2t, and of sixty to make the Image 3p 3t. But for want of solid Glass Prisms with Angles of convenient bignesses, there may be Vessels made of polished Plates of Glass cemented together in the form of Prisms and filled with Water. These things being thus ordered, I observed that all the solar Images or coloured Spectrums PT, pt, 2p 2t, 3p 3t did very nearly converge to the place S on which the direct Light of the Sun fell and painted his white round Image when the Prisms were taken away. The Axis of the Spectrum PT, that is the Line drawn through the middle of it Parallel to <56> its Rectilinear Sides, did when produced pass exactly through the middle of that white round Image S. And when the Refraction of the second Prism was equal to the Refraction of the first, the refracting Angles of them both being about 60 Degrees, the Axis of the Spectrum 3p 3t made by that Refraction, did when produced pass also through the middle of the same white round Image S. But when the Refraction of the second Prism was less than that of the first, the produced Axes of the Spectrums tp or 2t 2p made by that Refraction did cut the produced Axis of the Spectrum TP in the Points m and n, a little beyond the Center of that white round Image S. Whence the Proportion of the Line 3tT to the Line 3pP was a little greater than the Proportion of 2tT or 2pP, and this Proportion a little greater than that of tT to pP. Now when the Light of the Spectrum PT falls perpendicularly upon the Wall, those Lines 3tT, 3pP, and 2tT, 2pP and tT, pP, are the Tangents of the Refractions; and therefore by this Experiment the Proportions of the Tangents of the Refractions are obtained, from whence the Proportions of the Sines being derived, they come out equal, so far as by viewing the Spectrums and using some Mathematical Reasoning I could estimate. For I did not make an Accurate Computation. So then the Proposition holds true in every Ray apart, so far as appears by Experiment. And that it is accurately true may be demonstrated upon this Supposition, That Bodies refract Light by acting upon its Rays in Lines Perpendicular to their Surfaces. But in order to this Demonstration, I must distinguish the Motion of every Ray into two Motions, the one Perpendicular to the refracting Surface, the other Parallel to it, and concerning the Perpendicular Motion lay down the following Proposition.
<57>
If any Motion or moving thing whatsoever be incident with any velocity on any broad and thin Space terminated on both sides by two parallel Planes, and in its passage through that space be urged perpendicularly towards the further Plane by any force which at given distances from the Plane is of given quantities; the perpendicular Velocity of that Motion or Thing, at its emerging out of that space, shall be always equal to the Square Root of the summ of the Square of the perpendicular Velocity of that Motion or Thing at its Incidence on that space; and of the Square of the perpendicular Velocity which that Motion or Thing would have at its Emergence, if at its Incidence its perpendicular Velocity was infinitely little.
And the same Proposition holds true of any Motion or Thing perpendicularly retarded in its passage through that space, if instead of the Summ of the two Squares you take their difference. The Demonstration Mathematicians will easily find out, and therefore I shall not trouble the Reader with it.
Suppose now that a Ray coming most obliquely in the Line MC be refracted at C by the Plane RS into the Line CN,[Image 33] and if it be required to find the Line CE into which any other Ray AC shall be refracted; let MC, AD, be the Sines of incidence of the two Rays, and NG, EF, their Sines of Refraction, and let the equal Motions of the incident Rays be represented by the equal Lines MC and AC, and the Motion MC being considered as parallel to the refracting Plane, let the other Motion AC be distinguished into two Motions AD and DC, one of which AD is parallel, and the other DC perpendicular to the refracting Surface. In like manner, let the Motions of the emerging Rays be distinguish'd into two, whereof the per <58> pendicular ones are  and . And if the force of the refracting Plane begins to act upon the Rays either in that Plane or at a certain distance from it on the one side, and ends at a certain distance from it on the other side, and in all places between those two Limits acts upon the Rays in Lines perpendicular to that refracting Plane, and the Actions upon the Rays at equal distances from the refracting Plane be equal, and at unequal ones either equal or unequal according to any rate whatever; that motion of the Ray which is Parallel to the refracting Plane will suffer no alteration by that force; and that motion which is perpendicular to it will be altered according to the rule of the foregoing Proposition. If therefore for the perpendicular Velocity of the emerging Ray CN you write  as above, then the perpendicular Velocity of any other emerging Ray CE which was , will be equal to the square Root of . And by squaring these equals, and adding to them the Equals ADq and MCq---CDq, and dividing the Summs by the Equals CFq + EFq and CGq + NGq, you will have  equal to . Whence AD, the Sine of Incidence, is to EF the Sine of Refraction, as MC to NG, that is, in a given ratio. And this Demonstration being general, without determining what Light is, or by what kind of force it is refracted, or assuming any thing further than that the refracting Body acts upon the Rays in Lines perpendicular to its Surface; I take it to be a very convincing Argument of the full Truth of this Proposition.
<59>
So then, if the ratio of the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of any sort of Rays be found in any one Case, 'tis given in all Cases; and this may be readily found by the Method in the following Proposition.
PROP. VII. Theor. VI.
The Perfection of Telescopes is impeded by the different Refrangibility of the Rays of Light.
THE imperfection of Telescopes is vulgarly attributed to the spherical Figures of the Glasses, and therefore Mathematicians have propounded to Figure them by the Conical Sections. To shew that they are mistaken, I have inserted this Proposition; the truth of which will appear by the measures of the Refractions of the several sorts of Rays; and these measures I thus determine.
In the third Experiment of the first Book, where the refracting Angle of the Prism was  degrees, the half of that Angle 31 deg. 15 min. is the Angle of Incidence of the Rays at their going out of the Glass into the Air; and the Sine of this Angle is 5188, the Radius being 10000. When the Axis of this Prism was parallel to the Horizon, and the Refraction of the Rays at their Incidence on this Prism equal to that at their Emergence out of it, I observed with a Quadrant the Angle which the mean refrangible Rays (that is, those which went to the middle of the Sun's coloured Image) made with the Horizon and by this Angle and the Sun's altitude observed at the same time, I found the Angle which the emergent Rays contained with the incident to be 44 deg. and 40 min. and the half of this Angle added to the Angle of Incidence 31 deg. 15 min. makes the <60> Angle of Refraction, which is therefore 53 deg. 35 min. and its Sine 8047. These are the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of the mean refrangible Rays, and their proportion in round numbers is 20 to 31. This Glass was of a Colour inclining to green. The last of the Prisms mentioned in the third Experiment was of clear white Glass. Its refracting Angle  degrees. The Angle which the emergent Rays contained, with the incident 45 deg. 50 min. The Sine of half the first Angle 5262. The Sine of half the Summ of the Angles 8157. And their proportion in round numbers 20 to 31 as before.
From the Length of the Image, which was about  or 10 Inches, subduct its Breadth, which was  Inches, and the Remainder  Inches would be the length of the Image were the Sun but a point, and therefore subtends the Angle which the most and least refrangible Rays, when incident on the Prism in the same Lines, do contain with one another after their Emergence. Whence this Angle is 2 deg. 0′. 7″. For the distance between the Image and the Prism where this Angle is made, was  Feet, and at that distance the Chord  Inches subtends an Angle of 2 deg. 0′ 7″. Now half this Angle is the Angle which these emergent Rays contain with the emergent mean refrangible Rays, and a quarter thereof, that is 30′. 2″. may be accounted the Angle which they would contain with the same emergent mean refrangible Rays, were they co-incident to them within the Glass and suffered no other Refraction then that at their Emergence. For if two equal Refractions, the one at the incidence of the Rays on the Prism, the other at their Emergence, make half the Angle 2 deg. 0′. 7″. then one of those Refractions will make about a quarter of that Angle, and this quarter added to <61> and subducted from the Angle of Refraction of the mean refrangible Rays, which was 53 deg. 35′, gives the Angles of Refraction of the most and least refrangible Rays 54 deg. 5′ 2″, and 53 deg. 4′ 58″, whose Sines are 8099 and 7995, the common Angle of Incidence being 31 deg. 15′ and its Sine 5188; and these Sines in the least round numbers are in proportion to one another as 78 and 77 to 50.
Now if you subduct the common Sine of Incidence 50 from the Sines of Refraction 77 and 78, the remainders 27 and 28 shew that in small Refractions the Refraction of the least refrangible Rays is to the Refraction of the most refrangible ones as 27 to 28 very nearly, and that the difference of the Refractions of the least refrangible and most refrangible Rays is about the th part of the whole Refraction of the mean refrangible Rays.
Whence they that are skilled in Opticks will easily understand, that the breadth of the least circular space into which Object-Glasses of Telescopes can collect all sorts of Parallel Rays, is about the th part of half the aperture of the Glass, or 55th Part of the whole aperture; and that the Focus of the most refrangible Rays is nearer to the Object-Glass than the Focus of the least refrangible ones, by about the th part of the distance between the Object-Glass and the Focus of the mean refrangible ones.
And if Rays of all sorts, flowing from any one lucid point in the Axis of any convex Lens, be made by the Refraction of the Lens to converge to points not too remote from the Lens, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the Lens than the Focus of the least refrangible ones, by a distance which is to the th part of the distance of the Focus of the mean refrangible Rays from the Lens as the distance between that Focus and the lucid <62> point from whence the Rays flow is to the distance between that lucid point and the Lens very nearly.
Now to examine whether the difference between the Refractions which the most refrangible and the least refrangible Rays flowing from the same point suffer in the Object-Glasses of Telescopes and such like Glasses, be so great as is here described, I contrived the following Experiment.
Exper. 16. The Lens which I used in the second and eighth Experiments, being placed six Feet and an Inch distant from any Object, collected the Species of that Object by the mean refrangible Rays at the distance of six Feet and an Inch from the Lens on the other side. And therefore by the foregoing Rule it ought to collect the Species of that Object by the least refrangible Rays at the distance of six Feet and  Inches from the Lens, and by the most refrangible ones at the distance of five Feet and  Inches from it: So that between the two places where these least and most refrangible Rays collect the Species, there may be the distance of about  Inches. For by that Rule, as six Feet and an Inch (the distance of the Lens from the lucid Object) is to twelve Feet and two Inches (the distance of the lucid Object from the Focus of the mean refrangible Rays) that is, as one is to two, so is the th part of six Feet and an Inch (the distance between the Lens and the same Focus) to the distance between the Focus of the most refrangible Rays and the Focus of the least refrangible ones, which is therefore  Inches, that is very nearly  Inches. Now to know whether this measure was true, I repeated the second and eighth Experiment of this Book with coloured Light, which was less compounded than that I there made use of: For I now separated the <63> heterogeneous Rays from one another by the method I described in the 11th Experiment, so as to make a coloured Spectrum about twelve or fifteen times longer than broad. This Spectrum I cast on a printed book, and placing the above-mentioned Lens at the distance of six Feet and an Inch from this Spectrum to collect the Species of the illuminated Letters at the same distance on the other side, I found that the Species of the Letters illuminated with Blue were nearer to the Lens than those illuminated with deep Red by about three Inches or three and a quarter: but the Species of the Letters illuminated with Indigo and Violet appeared so confused and indistinct, that I could not read them: Whereupon viewing the Prism, I found it was full of Veins running from one end of the Glass to the other; so that the Refraction could not be regular. I took another Prism therefore which was free from Veins, and instead of the Letters I used two or three parallel black Lines a little broader than the strokes of the Letters, and casting the Colours upon these Lines in such manner that the Lines ran along the Colours from one end of the Spectrum to the other, I found that the Focus where the Indigo, or confine of this colour and Violet cast the Species of the black Lines most distinctly, to be about 4 Inches or  nearer to the Lens than the Focus where the deepest Red cast the Species of the same black Lines most distinctly. The violet was so faint and dark, that I could not discern the Species of the Lines distinctly by that Colour; and therefore considering that the Prism was made of a dark coloured Glass inclining to Green, I took another Prism of clear white Glass; but the Spectrum of Colours which this Prism made had long white streams of faint Light shooting out from both ends of the Colours, which made me conclude that something was amiss; and view <64> ing the Prism, I found two or three little Bubbles in the Glass which refracted the Light irregulariy. Wherefore I covered that part of the Glass with black Paper, and letting the Light pass through another part of it which was free from such Bubbles, the Spectrum of Colours became free from those irregular Streams of Light, and was now such as I desired. But still I found the Violet so dark and faint, that I could scarce see the Species of the Lines by the Violet, and not at all by the deepest part of it, which was next the end of the Spectrum. I suspected therefore that this faint and dark Colour might be allayed by that scattering Light which was refracted, and reflected irregularly, partly by some very small Bubbles in the Glasses and partly by the inequalities of their Polish: which Light, tho' it was but little, yet it being of a White Colour, might suffice to affect the Sense so strongly as to disturb the Phænomena of that weak and dark Colour the Violet, and therefore I tried, as in the 12th, 13th, 14th Experiments, whether the Light of this Colour did not consist of a sensible mixture of heterogeneous Rays, but found it did not. Nor did the Refractions cause any other sensible Colour than Violet to emerge out of this Light, as they would have done out of White Light, and by consequence out of this Violet Light had it been sensibly compounded with White Light. And therefore I concluded, that the reason why I could not see the Species of the Lines distinctly by this Colour, was only the darkness of this Colour and Thinness of its Light, and its distance from the Axis of the Lens; I divided therefore those Parallel Black Lines into equal Parts, by which I might readily know the distances of the Colours in the Spectrum from one another, and noted the distances of the Lens from the Foci of such Colours as cast the Species of the <65> Lines distinctly, and,then considered whether the difference of those distances bear such proportion to  Inches, the greatest difference of the distances which the Foci of the deepest Red and Violet ought to have from the Lens, as the distance of the observed Colours from one another in the Spectrum bear to the like distance of the deepest Red and Violet measured in the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum, that is, to the length of those sides or excess of the length of the Spectrum above its breadth. And my Observations were as follows.
When I observed and compared the deepest sensible Red, and the Colour in the Confine of Green and Blue, which at the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum was distant from it half the length of those sides, the Focus where the Confine of Green and Blue cast the Species of the Lines distinctly on the Paper, was nearer to the Lens than the Focus where the Red cast those Lines distinctly on it by about  or  Inches. For sometimes the Measures were a little greater, sometimes a little less, but seldom varied from one another above  of an Inch. For it was very difficult to define the places of the Foci, without some little Errors. Now if the Colours distant half the length of the Image, (measured at its rectilinear sides) give  or  difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, then the Colours distant the whole length ought to give 5 or  Inches difference of those distances.
But here it's to be noted, that I could not see the Red to the full End of the Spectrum, but only to the Center of the Semicircle which bounded that End, or a little farther; and therefore I compared this Red not with that Colour which was exactly in the middle of the Spectrum, or Confine of Green and Blue, but with that which verged a little more to the Blue than to the Green: And as I reck <66> oned the whole length of the Colours not to be the whole length of the Spectrum, but the length of its rectilinear sides, so completing the Semicirlar Ends into Circles, when either of the observed Colours fell within those Circles, I measured the distance of that Colour from the End of the Spectrum, and subducting half this distance from the measured distance of the Colours, I took the remainder for their corrected distance; and in these Observations set down this corrected distance for the difference of the distances from the Lens. For as the length of the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum would be the whole length of all the Colours, were the Circles of which (as we shewed) that Spectrum consists contracted and reduced to Physical Points, so in that Case this corrected distance would be the real distance of the observed Colours.
When therefore I further observed the deepest sensible Red, and that Blue whose corrected distance from it was  parts of the length of the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens was about  Inches, and as 7 to 12 so is  to .
When I observed the deepest sensible Red, and that Indigo whose corrected distance was  or  of the length of the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, was about  Inches, and as 2 to 3 so is  to .
When I observed the deepest sensible Red, and that deep Indigo whose corrected distance from one another was  or  of the length of the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens was about 4 Inches; and as 3 to 4 so is 4 to .
When I observed the deepest sensible Red, and that part of the Violet next the Indigo whose corrected distance from the Red was  or  of the length of the rectilinear sides of <67> the Spectrum, the difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens was about  Inches; and as 5 to 6, so is  to {}. For sometimes when the Lens was advantagiously placed, so that its Axis respected the Blue, and all things else were well ordered, and the Sun shone clear, and I held my Eye very near to the Paper on which the Lens cast the Species of the Lines, I could see pretty distinctly the Species of those Lines by that part of the Violet which was next the Indigo; and sometimes I could see them by above half the Violet. For in making these Experiments I had observed, that the Species of those Colours only appear distinct which were in or near the Axis of the Lens: So that if the Blue or Indigo were in the Axis, I could see their Species distinctly; and then the Red appeared much less distinct than before. Wherefore I contrived to make the Spectrum of Colours shorter than before, so that both its Ends might be nearer to the Axis of the Lens. And now its length was about  Inches and breadth about  or  of an Inch. Also instead of the black Lines on which the Spectrum was cast, I made one black Line broader than those, that I might see its Species more easily; and this Line I divided by short cross Lines into equal Parts, for measuring the distances of the observed Colours. And now I could sometimes see the Species of this Line with its divisions almost as far as the Centers of the Semicircular Violet End of the Spectrum, and made these further Observations.
When I observed the deepest sensible Red, and that part of the Violet whose corrected distance from it was about  Parts of the rectilinear sides of the Spectrum the difference of the distances of the Foci of those Colours from the Lens, was one time , another time , another time {} Inches, and as 8 to 9, so are , , {}, to    respectively.
<68>
When I observed the deepest sensible Red, and deepest sensible Violet, (the corrected distance of which Colours when all things were ordered to the best advantage, and the Sun shone very clear, was about  or  parts of the length of the rectilinear sides of the coloured Spectrum) I found the difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens sometimes  sometimes , and for the most part 5 Inches or thereabouts: and as 11 to 12 or 15 to 16, so is five Inches to  or  Inches.
And by this progression of Experiments I satisfied my self, that had the Light at the very Ends of the Spectrum been strong enough to make the Species of the black Lines appear plainly on the Paper, the Focus of the deepest Violet would have been found nearer to the Lens, than the Focus of the deepest Red, by about  Inches at least. And this is a further Evidence, that the Sines of Incidence and Refraction of the several sorts of Rays, hold the same proportion to one another in the smallest Refractions which they do in the greatest.
My progress in making this nice and troublesome Experiment I have set down more at large, that they that shall try it after me may be aware of the Circumspection requisite to make it succeed well. And if they cannot make it succeed so well as I did, they may notwithstanding collect by the Proportion of the distance of the Colours of the Spectrum, to the difference of the distances of their Foci from the Lens, what would be the success in the more distant Colours by a better Trial. And yet if they use a broader Lens than I did, and fix it to a long streight Staff by means of which it may be readily and truly directed to the Colour whose Focus is desired, I question not but the Experiment will succeed better with them than it did with me. For I directed the Axis as nearly as I could to the <69> middle of the Colours, and then the faint Ends of the Spectrum being remote from the Axis, cast their Species less distinctly on the Paper than they would have done had the Axis been successively directed to them.
Now by what has been said, its certain that the Rays which differ in refrangibility do not converge to the same Focus, but if they flow from a lucid point, as far from the Lens on one side as their Foci are on the other, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the Lens than that of the least refrangible, by above the fourteenth part of the whole distance: and if they flow from a lucid point, so very remote from the Lens that before their Incidence they may be accounted Parallel, the Focus of the most refrangible Rays shall be nearer to the Lens than the Focus of the least refrangible, by about the 27th or 28th part of their whole distance from it. And the Diameter of the Circle in the middle space between those two Foci which they illuminate when they fall there on any Plane, perpendicular to the Axis (which Circle is the least into which they can all be gathered) is about the 55th part of the Diameter of the aperture of the Glass. So that 'tis a wonder that Telescopes represent Objects so distinct as they do. But were all the Rays of Light equally refrangible, the Error arising only from the Sphericalness of the Figures of Glasses would be many hundred times less. For if the Object-glass of a Telescope be Plano-convex, and the Plane side be turned towards the Object, and the Diameter of the Sphere whereof this Glass is a segment, be called D, and the Semidiameter of the aperture of the Glass be called S, and the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air, be to the Sine of Refraction as I to R: the Rays which come Parallel to the Axis of the Glass, shall in the place where the Image of the Object is most distinctly made, be scattered all over a little <70> Circle whose Diameter is  very nearly, as I gather by computing the Errors of the Rays by the method of infinite Series, and rejecting the Terms whose quantities are inconsiderable. As for instance, if the Sine of Incidence I, be to the Sine of Refraction R, as 20 to 31, and if D the Diameter of the Sphere to which the Convex side of the Glass is ground, be 100 Feet or 1200 Inches, and S the Semidiameter of the aperture be two Inches, the Diameter of the little Circle, (that is ) will be  (or ) parts of an Inch. But the Diameter of the little Circle through which these Rays are scattered by unequal refrangibility, will be about the 55th part of the aperture of the Object-glass, which here is four Inches. And therefore the Error arising from the spherical Figure of the Glass, is to the Error arising from the different Refrangibility of the Rays, as  to  that is as 1 to 8151: and therefore being in Comparison so very little, deserves not to be considered.
But you will say, if the Errors caused by the different refrangibility be so very great, how comes it to pass that Objects appear through Telescopes so distinct as they do? I answer, 'tis because the erring Rays are not scattered uniformly over all that circular space, but collected infinitely more densely in the Center than in any other part of the Circle, and in the way from the Center to the Circumference grow continually rarer and rarer, so as at the Circumference to become infinitely rare; and by reason of their rarity are not strong enough to be visible, unless in the Center and very near it. Let ADE represent one of those Circles described with the Center C and Semidiameter AC, and let BFG be a smaller Circle concentric to the former,[Image 34] cutting <71> with its Circumference the Diameter AC in B, and bisect AC in N, and by my reckoning the density of the Light in any Place B will be to its density in N, as AB to BC; and the whole Light within the lesser Circle BFG, will be to the whole Light within the greater AED, as the Excess of the Square of AC above the Square of AB, is to the Square of AC. As if BC be the fifth part of AC, the Light will be four times denser in B than in N, and the whole Light within the less Circle, will be to the whole Light within the greater, as nine to twenty five. Whence it's evident that the Light within the less Circle, must strike the sense much more strongly, than that faint and dilated Light round about between it and the Circumference of the greater.
But its further to be noted, that the most luminous of the prismatick Colours are the Yellow and Orange. These affect the Senses more strongly than all the rest together, and next to these in strength are the Red and Green. The Blue compared with these is a faint and dark Colour, and the Indigo and Violet are much darker and fainter, so that these compared with the stronger Colours are little to be regarded. The Images of Objects are therefore to be placed, not in the Focus of the mean refrangible Rays which are in the confine of Green and Blue, but in the Focus of those Rays which are in the middle of the Orange and Yellow; there where the Colour is most luminous and fulgent, that is in the brightest Yellow, that Yellow which inclines more to Orange than to Green. And by the Refraction of these Rays (whose Sines of Incidence and Refraction in Glass are as 17 and 11) the Refraction of Glass and Crystal for optical uses is to be measured. Let us therefore place the Image of the Object in the Focus of these Rays, and all the Yellow and Orange will fall within a Circle, whose Diameter is about the 250th Part of the Diameter of the aper <72> ture of the Glass. And if you add the brighter half of the Red, (that half which is next the Orange, and the brighter half of the Green, (that half which is next the Yellow,) about three fifth parts of the Light of these two Colours will fall within the same Circle, and two fifth parts will fall without it round about; and that which falls without will be spread through almost as much more space as that which falls within, and so in the gross be almost three times rarer. Of the other half of the Red and Green, (that is of the deep dark Red and Willow Green) about one quarter will fall within this Circle, and three quarters without, and that which falls without will be spread through about four or five times more space than that which falls within; and so in the gross be rarer, and if compared with the whole Light within it, will be about 25 times rarer than all that taken in the gross; or rather more than 30 or 40 times rarer, because the deep red in the end of the Spectrum of Colours made by a Prism is very thin and rare, and the Willow Green is something rarer than the Orange and Yellow. The Light of these Colours therefore being so very much rarer than that within the Circle, will scarce affect the Sense, especially since the deep Red and Willow Green of this Light, are much darker Colours than the rest. And for the same reason the Blue and Violet being much darker Colours than these, and much more rarified, may be neglected. For the dense and bright Light of the Circle, will obscure the rare and weak Light of these dark Colours round about it, and render fhem almost insensible. The sensible Image of a lucid point is therefore scarce broader than a Circle whose Diameter is the 250th part of the diameter of the aperture of the Object Glass of a good Telescope, or not much broader, if you except a faint and dark misty light round about it, which a Spectator will scarce regard. And therefore in a Telescope <73> whose aperture is four Inches, and length an hundred Feet, it exceeds not 2″ 45", or 3″. And in a Telescope whose aperture is two Inches, and length 20 or 30 Feet, it may be 5″ or 6″ and scarce above. And this Answers well to Experience: For some Astronomers have found the Diameters of the fixt Stars, in Telescopes of between twenty and sixty Feet in length, to be about 4″ or 5″, or at most 6″ in diameter. But if the Eye-Glass be tincted faintly with the smoke of a Lamp or Torch, to obscure the Light of the Star, the fainter Light in the Circumference of the Star ceases to be visible, and the Star (if the Glass be sufficiently soiled with smoke) appears something more like a Mathematical Point. And for the same reason, the enormous part of the Light in the Circumference of every lucid Point ought to be less discernable in shorter Telescopes than in longer, because the shorter transmit less Light to the Eye.
Now if we suppose the sensible Image of a lucid Point, to be even 250 times narrower than the aperture of the Glass: yet were it not for the different refrangibility of the Rays, its breadth in an 100 Foot Telescope whose aperture is 4 Inches would be but  parts of an Inch, as is manifest by the foregoing Computation. And therefore in this Case the greatest Errors arising from the spherical Figure of the Glass, would be to the greatest sensible Errors arising from the different refrangibility of the Rays as  to  at most, that is only as 1 to 1826. And this sufficiently shews that it is not the spherical Figures of Glasses but the different refrangibility of the Rays which hinders the perfection of Telescopes.
There is another Argument by which it may appear that the different refrangibility of Rays, is the true cause of the imperfection of Telescopes. For the Errors of the Rays arising from the spherical Figures of Object-Glasses, are as <74> the Cubes of the apertures of the Object-Glasses; and thence to make Telescopes of various lengths, magnify with equal distinctness, the apertures of the Object-Glasses, and the Charges or magnifying Powers, ought to be as the Cubes of the square Roots of their lengths; which doth not answer to Experience. But the errors of the Rays arising from the different refrangibility, are as the apertures of the Object-Glasses, and thence to make Telescopes of various lengths, magnify with equal distinctness, their apertures and charges ought to be as the square Roots of their lengths; and this answers to experience as is well known. For instance, a Telescope of 64 Feet in length, with an aperture of  Inches, magnifies about 120 times, with as much distinctness as one of a Foot in length, with {} of an Inch aperture, magnifies 15 times.
Now were it not for this different refrangibility of Rays, Telescopes might be brought to a greater Perfection than we have yet described, by composing the Object-Glass of two Glasses with Water between them. Let ADFC represent the Object-Glass composed of two Glasses ABED and BEFC,[Image 35] alike convex on the outsides AGD and CHF, and alike concave on the insides BME, BNE, with Water in the concavity BMEN. Let the Sine of Incidence out of Glass into Air be as I to R and out of Water into Air as K to R, and by consequence out of Glass into Water, as I to K: and let the Diameter of the Sphere to which the convex sides AGD and CHF are ground be D, and the Diameter of the Sphere to which the concave sides BME and BNE are ground be to D, as the Cube Root of KK-KI to the Cube Root of RK-RI: and the Refractions on the concave sides of the Glasses, will very much correct the Errors of the Refractions on the convex sides, so far as they arise from the sphericalness of the Figure. And by this means <75> might Telescopes be brought to sufficient perfection, were it not for the different refrangibility of several sorts of Rays. But by reason of this different refrangibility, I do not yet see any other means of improving Telescopes by Refractions alone than that of increasing their lengths, for which end the late contrivance of Hugenius seems well accommodated. For very long Tubes are cumbersome, and scarce to be readily managed, and by reason of their length are very apt to bend, and shake by bending so as to cause a continual trembling in the Objects, whereby it becomes difficult to see them distinctly: whereas by his contrivance the Glasses are readily manageable, and the Object-Glass being fixt upon a strong upright Pole becomes more steddy.
Seeing therefore the improvement of Telescopes of given lengths by Refractions is desperate; I contrived heretofore a Perspective by reflexion, using instead of an Object-Glass a concave Metal. The diameter of the Sphere to which the Metal was ground concave was about 25 English Inches, and by consequence the length of the Instrument about six Inches and a quarter. The Eye-Glass was plano-convex, and the Diameter of the Sphere to which the convex side was ground was about  of an Inch, or a little less, and by consequence it magnified between 30 and 40 times. By another way of measuring I found that it magnified about 35 times. The Concave Metal bore an aperture of an Inch and a third part; but the aperture was limited not by an opake Circle, covering the Limb of the Metal round about, but by an opake circle placed between the Eye-Glass and the Eye, and perforated in the middle with a little round hole for the Rays to pass through to the Eye. For this Circle by being placed here, stopt much of the erroneous Light, which otherwise would have disturbed the Vision. By comparing it with a pretty good Perspective of four Feet in <76> length, made with a concave Eye-Glass, I could read at a greater distance with my own Instrument than with the Glass. Yet Objects appeared much darker in it than in the Glass, and that partly because more Light was lost by reflexion in the Metal, then by refraction in the Glass, and partly because my Instrument was overcharged. Had it magnified but 30 or 25 times it would have made the Object appear more brisk and pleasant. Two of these I made about 16 Years ago, and have one of them still by me by which I can prove the truth of what I write. Yet it is not so good as at the first. For the concave has been divers times tarnished and cleared again, by rubbing it with very soft Leather. When I made these, an Artist in London undertook to imitate it; but using another way of polishing them than I did, he fell much short of what I had attained to, as I afterwards understood by discoursing the under-Workman he had imployed. The Polish I used was in this manner. I had two round Copper Plates each six Inches in Diameter, the one convex the other concave, ground very true to one another. On the convex I ground the Object-Metal or concave which was to be polish'd, till it had taken the Figure of the convex and was ready for a Polish. Then I pitched over the convex very thinly, by dropping melted pitch upon it and warming it to keep the pitch soft, whilst I ground it with the concave Copper wetted to make it spread eavenly all over the convex. Thus by working it well I made it as thin as a Groat, and after the convex was cold I ground it again to give it as true a Figure as I could. Then I took Putty which I had made very fine by washing it from all its grosser Particles, and laying a little of this upon the pitch, I ground it upon the Pitch with the concave Copper till it had done making a noise; and then upon the Pitch I ground the Object-Metal with a brisk <77> Motion, for about two or three Minutes of time, leaning hard upon it. Then I put fresh Putty upon the Pitch and ground it again till it had done making a noise, and afterwards ground the Object Metal upon it as before. And this Work I repeated till the Metal was polished, grinding it the last time with all my strength for a good while together, and frequently breathing upon the Pitch to keep it moist without laying on any more fresh Putty. The Object-Metal was two Inches broad and about one third part of an Inch thick, to keep it from bending. I had two of these Metals, and when I had polished them both I tried which was best, and ground the other again to see if I could make it better than that which I kept. And thus by many Trials I learn'd the way of polishing, till I made those two reflecting Perspectives I spake of above. For this Art of polishing will be better learnt by repeated Practice than by my description. Before I ground the Object Metal on the Pitch, I always ground the Putty on it with the concave Copper till it had done making a noise, because if the Particles of the Putty were not by this means made to stick fast in the Pitch, they would by rolling up and down grate and fret the Object Metal and fill it full of little holes.
But because Metal is more difficult to polish than Glass and is afterwards very apt to be spoiled by tarnishing, and reflects not so much Light as Glass quick-silvered over does: I would propound to use instead of the Metal, a Glass ground concave on the foreside, and as much convex on the backside, and quick-silvered over on the convex side. The Glass must be every where of the same thickness exactly. Otherwise it will make Objects look coloured and indistinct. By such a Glass I tried about five or six Years ago to make a reflecting Telescope of four Feet in length to magnify about 150 times, and I satisfied my self that there wants no <78> thing but a good Artist to bring the design to perfection. For the Glass being wrought by one of our London Artists after such a manner as they grind Glasses for Telescopes, tho it seemed as well wrought as the Object Glasses use to be, yet when it was quick-silvered, the reflexion discovered innumerable Inequalities all over the Glass. And by reason of these Inequalities, Objects appeared indistinct in this Instrument. For the Errors of reflected Rays caused by any Inequality of the Glass, are about six times greater than the Errors of refracted Rays caused by the like Inequalities. Yet by this Experiment I satisfied my self that the reflexion on the concave side of the Glass, which I feared would disturb the vision, did no sensible prejudice to it, and by consequence that nothing is wanting to perfect these Telescopes, but good Workmen who can grind and polish Glasses truly spherical. An Object-Glass of a fourteen Foot Telescope, made by one of our London Artificers, I once mended considerably, by grinding it on Pitch with Putty, and leaning very easily on it in the grinding, lest the Putty should scratch it. Whether this way may not do well enough for polishing these reflecting Glasses, I have not yet tried. But he that shall try either this or any other way of polishing which he may think better, may do well to make his Glasses ready for polishing by grinding them without that violence, wherewith our London Workmen press their Glasses in grinding. For by such violent pressure, Glasses are apt to bend a little in the grinding, and such bending will certainly spoil their Figure. To recommend therefore the consideration of these reflecting Glasses, to such Artists as are curious in figuring Glasses, I shall describe this Optical Instrument in the following Proposition.
<79>
PROP. VII. Prob. II.
To shorten Telescopes.
LET ABCD represent a Glass spherically concave on the foreside AB,[Image 36] and as much convex on the backside CD, so that it be every where of an equal thickness. Let it not be thicker on one side than on the other, lest it make Objects appear coloured and indistinct, and let it be very truly wrought and quick-silvered over on the backside; and set in the Tube VXYZ which must be very black within. Let EFG represent a Prism of Glass or Crystal placed near the other end of the Tube, in the middle of it, by means of a handle of Brass or Iron FGK, to the end of which made flat it is cemented. Let this Prism be rectangular at E, and let the other two Angles at F and G be accurately equal to each other, and by consequence equal to half right ones, and let the plane sides FE and GE be square, and by consequence the third side FG a rectangular parallelogram, whose length is to its breadth in a subduplicate proportion of two to one. Let it be so placed in the Tube, that the Axis of the Speculum may pass through the middle of the square side EF perpendicularly, and by consequence through the middle of the side FG at an Angle of 45 Degrees, and let the side EF be turned towards the Speculum, and the distance of this Prism from the Speculum be such that the Rays of the Light PQ, RS, &c. which are incident upon the Speculum in Lines parallel to the Axis thereof, may enter the Prism at the side EF, and be reflected by the side FG, and thence go out of it through the side GE, to the Point T which must be the common Focus of the Speculnm ABDC, and of a Plano-convex Eye-Glass H, through which those Rays must pass to the Eye. And let the Rays at their coming <80> out of the Glass pass through a small round hole, or aperture made in a little plate of Lead, Brass, or Silver, wherewith the Glass is to be covered, which hole must be no bigger than is necessary for light enough to pass through. For so it will render the Object distinct, the Plate in which 'tis made intercepting all the erroneous part of the Light which comes from the verges of the Speculum AB. Such an Instrument well made if it be 6 Foot long, (reckoning the length from the Speculum to the Prism, and thence to the Focus T) will bear an aperture of 6 Inches at the Speculum, and magnify between two and three hundred times. But the hole H here limits the aperture with more advantage, than if the aperture was placed at the Speculum. If the Insirument be made longer or shorter, the aperture must be in proportion as the Cube of the square Root of the length, and the magnifying as the aperture. But its convenient that the Speculum be an Inch or two broader than the aperture at the least, and that the Glass of the Speculum be thick, that it bend not in the working. The Prism EFG must be no bigger than is necessary, and its back side FG must not be quick-silvered over. For without quick-silver it will reflect all the Light incident on it from the Speculum.
In this Instrument the Object will be inverted, but may be erected by making the square sides FF and EG of the Prism EFG not plane but spherically convex, that the Rays may cross as well before they come at it as afterwards between it and the Eye-Glass. If it be desired that the Instrument bear a larger aperture, that may be also done by composing the Speculum of two Glasses with Water between them.

PROP. I. THEOR. I.
The Phænomena of Colours in refracted or reflected Light are not caused by new modifications of the Light variously impresst, according to the various terminations of the Light and Shadow.
The Proof by Experiments.
EXPER. I.
FOR if the Sun shine into a very dark Chamber through an oblong Hole F,[Image 1] whose breadth is the sixth or eighth part of an Inch, or something less; and his Beam FH do afterwards pass first through a very large Prism ABC, distant about 20 Feet from the <82> Hole, and parallel to it, and then (with its white part) through an oblong Hole H, whose breadth is about the fortieth or sixtieth part of an Inch, and which is made in a black opake Body GI, and placed at the distance of two or three Feet from the Prism, in a parallel situation both to the Prism and to the former Hole, and if this white Light thus transmitted through the Hole H, fall afterwards upon a white Paper pt, placed after that Hole H, at the distance of three or four Feet from it, and there paint the usual Colours of the Prism, suppose red at t, yellow at s, green at r, blue at q, and violet at p; you may with an Iron Wire, or any such like slender opake Body, whose breadth is about the tenth part of an Inch, by intercepting the rays at k, l, m, n or o, take away any one of the Colours at t, s, r, q or p, whilst the other Colours remain upon the Paper as before; or with an obstacle something bigger you may take away any two, or three, or four Colours together, the rest remaining: So that any one of the Colours as well as violet may become outmost in the confine of the shadow towards p, and any one of them as well as red may become outmost in the confine of the shadow towards t, and any one of them may also border upon the shadow made within the Colours by the obstacle R intercepting some intermediate part of the Light; and, lastly, any one of them by being left alone may border upon the shadow on either hand. All the Colours have themselves indifferently to any confines of shadow, and therefore the differences of these Colours from one another, do not arise from the different confines of shadow, whereby Light is variously modified, as has hitherto been the Opinion of Philoso <83> phers. In trying these things 'tis to be observed, that by how much the Holes F and H are narrower, and the intervals between them, and the Prism greater, and the Chamber darker, by so much the better doth the Experiment succeed; provided the Light be not so far diminished, but that the Colours at pt be sufficiently visible. To procure a Prism of solid Glass large enough for this Experiment will be difficult, and therefore a prismatick Vessel must be made of polished Glass-plates cemented together, and filled with Water.
EXPER. II.
The Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through the round Hole F,[Image 2] half an Inch wide, passed first through the Prism ABC placed at the Hole, and then through a Lens PT something more than four Inches broad, and about eight Feet distant from the Prism, and thence converged to O the Focus of the Lens distant from it about three Feet, and there fell upon a white Paper DE. If that Paper was perpendicular to that Light incident upon it, as 'tis represented in the posture DE, all the Colours upon it at O appeared white. But if the Paper being turned about an Axis parallel to the Prism, became very much inclined to the Light, as 'tis represented in the Positions de and δε; the same Light in the one case appeared yellow and red, in the other blue. Here one and the same part of the Light in one and the same place, according to the various inclinations of the Paper, appeared in one case white, in another yellow or red, in a third blue, whilst the confine of Light and <84> Shadow, and the refractions of the Prism in all these cases remained the same.
EXPER. III.
Such another Experiment may be more easily tried as follows.[Image 3] Let a broad beam of the Sun's Light coming into a dark Chamber through a Hole in the Window shut be refracted by a large Prism ABC, whose refracting Angle C is more than 60 degrees, and so soon as it comes out of the Prism, let it fall upon the white Paper DE glewed upon a stiff plane; and this Light, when the Paper is perpendicular to it, as 'tis represented in DE, will appear perfectly white upon the Paper, but when the Paper is very much inclined to it in such a manner as to keep always parallel to the Axis of the Prism, the whiteness of the wHole Light upon the Paper will according to the inclination of the Paper this way, or that way, change either into yellow and red, as in the posture de, or into blue and violet, as in the posture δε. And if the Light before it fall upon the Paper be twice refracted the same way by two parallel Prisms, these Colours will become the more conspicuous. Here all the middle parts of the broad beam of white Light which fell upon the Paper, did without any confine of shadow to modify it, become coloured all over with one uniform Colour, the Colour being always the same in the middle of the Paper as at the edges, and this Colour changed according to the various obliquity of the reflecting Paper, without any change in the refractions or shadow, or in the Light which fell upon the Paper. And therefore these Colours are <85> to be derived from some other cause than the new modifications of Light by refractions and shadows.
If it be asked, What then is their cause? I answer, That the Paper in the posture de, being more oblique to the more refrangible rays than to the less refrangible ones, is more strongly illuminated by the latter than by the former, and therefore the less refrangible rays are predominant in the reflected Light. And wherever they are predominant in any Light they tinge it with red or yellow, as may in some measure appear by the first Proposition of the first Book, and will more fully appear hereafter. And the contrary happens in the posture of the Paper δε, the more refrangible rays being then predominant which always tinge Light with blues and violets.
EXPER. IV.
The Colours of Bubbles with which Children play are various, and change their situation variously, without any respect to any confine or shadow. If such a Bubble be covered with a concave Glass, to keep it from being agitated by any wind or motion of the Air, the Colours will slowly and regularly change their situation, even whilst the Eye, and the Bubble, and all Bodies which emit any Light, or cast any shadow, remain unmoved. And therefore their Colours arise from some regular cause which depends not on any confine of shadow. What this cause is will be shewed in the next Book.
<86>
To these Experiments may be added the tenth Experiment of the first Book, where the Sun's Light in a dark Room being trajected through the parallel superficies of two Prisms tied together in the form of a Parallelopide, became totally of one uniform yellow or red Colour, at its emerging out of the Prisms. Here, in the production of these Colours, the confine of shadow can have nothing to do. For the Light changes from white to yellow, orange and red successively, without any alteration of the confine of shadow: And at both edges of the emerging Light where the contrary confines of shadow ought to produce different effects, the Colour is one and the same, whether it be white, yellow, orange or red: And in the middle of the emerging Light, where there is no confine of shadow at all, the Colour is the very same as at the edges, the whole Light at its very first emergence being of one uniform Colour, whether white, yellow, orange or red, and going on thence perpetually without any change of Colour, such as the confine of shadow is vulgarly supposed to work in refracted Light after its emergence. Neither can these Colours arise from any new modifications of the Light by refractions, because they change successively from white to yellow, orange and red, while the refractions remain the same, and also because the refractions are made contrary ways by parallel superficies which destroy one anothers effects. They arise not therefore from any modifications of Light made by refractions and shadows, but have some other cause. What that cause is we shewed above in this tenth Experiment, and need not here repeat it.
<87>
There is yet another material circumstance of this Experiment.[Image 4] For this emerging Light being by a third Prism HIK refracted towards the Paper PT, and there painting the usual Colours of the Prism, red, yellow, green, blue, violet: If these Colours arose from the refractions of that Prism modifying the Light, they would not be in the Light before its incidence on that Prism. And yet in that Experiment we found that when by turning the two first Prisms about their common Axis all the Colours were made to vanish but the red; the Light which makes that red being left alone, appeared of the very same red Colour before its incidence on the third Prism. And in general we find by other Experiments that when the rays which differ in refrangibility are separated from one another, and any one sort of them is considered apart, the Colour of the Light which they compose cannot be changed by any refraction or reflexion whatever, as it ought to be were Colours nothing else than modifications of Light caused by refractions, and reflexions, and shadows. This unchangeableness of Colour I am now to describe in the following Proposition.
PROP. II. THEOR. II.
All homogeneal Light has its proper Colour answering to its degree of refrangibility, and that Colour cannot be changed by reflexions and refractions.
In the Experiments of the 4th Proposition of the first Book, when I had separated the heterogeneous rays from one another, the Spectrum pt formed by the sepa <88> rated rays, did in the Progress from its end p, on which the most refrangible rays fell, unto its other end t, on which the least refrangible rays fell, appear tinged with this Series of Colours, violet, indico, blue, green, yellow, orange, red, together with all their intermediate degrees in a continual succession perpetually varying: So that there appeared as many degrees of Colours, as there were sorts of rays differing in refrangibility.
EXPER. V.
Now that these Colours could not be changed by refraction, I knew by refracting with a Prism sometimes one very little part of this Light, sometimes another very little part, as is described in the 12th Experiment of the first Book. For by this refraction the Colour of the Light was never changed in the least. If any part of the red Light was refracted, it remained totally of the same red Colour as before. No orange, no yellow, no green, or blue, no other new Colour was produced by that refraction. Neither did the Colour any ways change by repeated refractions, but continued always the same red entirely as at first. The like constancy and immutability I found also in the blue, green, and other Colours. So also if I looked through a Prism upon any Body illuminated with any part of this homogeneal Light, as in the 14th Experiment of the first Book is described; I could not perceive any new Colour generated this way. All Bodies illuminated with compound Light appear through Prisms confused (as was said above) and tinged with various new Colours, but those illuminated with homogeneal Light appeared <89> through Prisms neither less distinct, nor otherwise coloured, than when viewed with the naked Eyes. Their Colours were not in the least changed by the refraction of the interposed Prism. I speak here of a sensible change of Colour: For the Light which I here call homogeneal, being not absolutely homogeneal, there ought to arise some little change of Colour from its heterogeneity. But if that heterogeneity was so little as it might be made, by the said Experiments of the fourth Proposition, that change was not sensible, and therefore, in Experiments where sense is judge, ought to be accounted none at all.
EXPER. VI.
And as these Colours were not changeable by refractions, so neither were they by reflexions. For all white, grey, red, yellow, green, blue, violet Bodies, as Paper, Ashes, red Lead, Orpiment, Indico Bise, Gold, Silver, Copper, Grass, blue Flowers, Violets, Bubbles of Water tinged with various Colours, Peacock's Feathers, the tincture of Lignum Nephriticum, and such like, in red homogeneal Light appeared totally red, in blue Light totally blue, in green Light totally green, and so of other Colours. In the homogeneal Light of any Colour they all appeared totally of that same Colour, with this only difference, that some of them reflected that Light more strongly, others more faintly. I never yet found any Body which by reflecting homogeneal Light could sensibly change its Colour.
<90>
From all which it is manifest, that if the Sun's Light consisted of but one sort of rays, there would be but one Colour in the whole World, nor would it be possible to produce any new Colour by reflexions and refractions, and by consequence that the variety of Colours depends upon the composition of Light.
DEFINITION.
The homogeneal light and rays which appear red, or rather make Objects appear so, I call rubrifick or red-making; those which make Objects appear yellow, green, blue, and violet, I call yellow-making, green-making, blue-making, violet-making, and so of the rest. And if at any time I speak of light and rays as coloured or endued with Colours, I would be understood to speak not philosophically and properly, but grossly, and accordingly to such conceptions as vulgar People in seeing all these Experiments would be apt to frame. For the rays to speak properly are not coloured. In them there is nothing else than a certain power and disposition to stir up a sensation of this or that Colour. For as Sound in a Bell or musical String, or other sounding Body, is nothing but a trembling Motion, and in the Air nothing but that Motion propagated from the Object, and in the Sensorium 'tis a Sense of that Motion under the form of sound; so Colours in the Object are nothing but a disposition to reflect this or that sort of rays more copiously than the rest; in the rays they are nothing but their dispositions to propa <91> gate this or that Motion into the Sensorium, and in the Sensorium they are sensations of those Motions under the forms of Colours.
PROP. III. PROB. I.
To define the refrangibility of the several sorts of homogeneal Light answering to the several Colours.
For determining this Problem I made the following Experiment.
EXPER. VII.
When I had caused the rectilinear sides AF, GM, of the Spectrum of Colours made by the Prism to be distinctly defined,[Image 5] as in the fifth Experiment of the first Book is described, there were found in it all the homogeneal Colours in the same order and situation one among another as in the Spectrum of simple Light, described in the fourth Experiment of that Book. For the Circles of which the Spectrum of compound Light PT is composed, and which in the middle parts of the Spectrum interfere and are intermixt with one another, are not intermixt in their outmost parts where they touch those rectilinear sides AF and GM. And therefore in those rectilinear sides when distinctly defined, there is no new Colour generated by refraction. I observed also, that if any where between the two outmost Circles TMF and PGA a right Line, as γδ, was cross to the Spectrum, so as both ends to fall perpendicularly upon its rectilinear sides, there appeared <92> one and the same Colour and degree of Colour from one end of this line to the other. I delineated therefore in a Paper the perimeter of the Spectrum FAPGMT, and in trying the third Experiment of the first Book, I held the Paper so that the Spectrum might fall upon this delineated Figure, and agree with it exactly, whilst an Assistant whose Eyes for distinguishing Colours were more critical than mine, did by right lines αβ, γδ, εζ, &c. drawn cross the Spectrum, note the confines of the Colours that is of the red MαβF of the orange αγδβ, of the yellow γεζδ, of the green εηθζ, of the blue ηιχθ, of the indico ιλμχ, and of the violet λGAμ. And this operation being divers times repeated both in the same and in several Papers, I found that the Observations agreed well enough with one another, and that the rectilinear sides MG and FA were by the said cross lines divided after the manner of a musical Chord. Let GM be produced to X, that MX may be equal to GM, and conceive GX, λX, ιX, ηX, εX, γX, αX, MX, to be in proportion to one another, as the numbers, 1, , , , , , , , and so to represent the Chords of the Key, and of a Tone, a third Minor, a fourth, a fifth, a sixth Major, a seventh, and an eighth above that Key: And the intervals Mα, αγ, γε, εη, ηι, ιλ, and λG, will be the spaces which the several Colours (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indico, violet) take up.
Now these intervals or spaces subtending the differences of the refraction of the rays going to the limits of those Colours, that is, to the Points M, α, γ, ε, η, ι, λ, G, may without any sensible Error be accounted proportional to the differences of the sines of refraction of those <93> rays having one common sine of incidence, and therefore since the common Sine of incidence of the most and least refrangible rays out of Glass into Air was (by a method described above) found in proportion to their sines of refraction, as 50 to 77 and 78, divide the difference between the sines of refraction 77 and 78, as the Line GM is divided by those intervals, you will have 77, , , , , , , 78, the sines of refraction of those rays out of Glass into Air, their common sine of incidence being 50. So then the sines of the incidences of all the red-making rays out of Glass into Air, were to the sines of their refractions, not greater than 50 to 77, nor less than 50 to , but they varied from one another according to all intermediate Proportions. And the sines of the incidences of the green-making rays were to the sines of their refractions in all proportions from that of 50 to {}, unto that of 50 to . And by the like limits above-mentioned were the refractions of the rays belonging to the rest of the Colours defined, the sines of the red-making rays extending from 77 to , those of the orange-making from  to , those of the yellow-making from  to , those of the green-making from  to , those of the blue-making from  to , those of the indico-making from  to , and those of the violet from  to 78.
These are the Laws of the refractions made out of Glass into Air, and thence by the three Axioms of the first Book the Laws of the refractions made out of Air into Glass are easily derived.
<94>
EXPER. VIII.
I found moreover that when Light goes out of Air through several contiguous refracting Mediums as through Water and Glass, and thence goes out again into Air, whether the refracting superficies be parallel or inclined to one another, that Light as often as by contrary refractions 'tis so corrected, that emergeth in lines parallel to those in which it was incident, continues ever after to be white. But if the emergent rays be inclined to the incident, the whiteness of the emerging Light will by degrees in passing on from the place of emergence, become tinged in its edges with Colours. This I tryed by refracting Light with Prisms of Glass placed within a prismatick Vessel of Water. Now those Colours argue a diverging and separation of the heterogeneous rays from one another by means of their unequal refractions, as in what follows will more fully appear. And, on the contrary, the permanent whiteness argues, that in like incidences of the rays there is no such separation of the emerging rays, and by consequence no inequality of their whole refractions. Whence I seem to gather the two following Theorems.
1. The Excesses of the sines of refraction of several sorts of rays above their common sine of incidence when the refractions are made out of divers denser mediums immediately into one and the same rarer medium, are to one another in a given Proportion.
<95>
2. The Proportion of the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction of one and the same sort of rays out of one medium into another, is composed of the Proportion of the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction out of the first medium into any third medium, and of the Proportion of the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction out of that third medium into the second medium.
By the first Theorem the refractions of the rays of every sort made out of any medium into Air are known by having the refraction of the rays of any one sort. As for instance, if the refractions of the rays of every sort out of Rain-water into Air be desired, let the common sine of incidence out of Glass into Air be subducted from the sines of refraction, and the Excesses will be 27, , , , , , , 28. Suppose now that the sine of incidence of the least refrangible rays be to their sine of refraction out of Rain-water into Air as three to four, and say as 1 the difference of those Sines is to 3 the sine of incidence, so is 27 the least of the Excesses above-mentioned to a fourth number 81; and 81 will be the common sine of incidence out of Rain-water into Air, to which sine if you add all the abovementioned Excesses you will have the desired sines of the refractions 108, , , , , , , 109.
By the latter Theorem the refraction out of one medium into another is gathered as often as you have the refractions out of them both into any third medium. As if the sine of incidence of any ray out of Glass into Air be to its sine of refraction as 20 to 31, and the sine of incidence of the same ray out of Air into Water, be <96> to its sine of refraction as four to three; the sine of incidence of that ray out of Glass into Water will be to its sine of refraction as 20 to 31 and 4 to 3 joyntly, that is, as the Factum of 20 and 4 to the Factum Of 31 and 3, or as 80 to 93.
And these Theorems being admitted into Opticks, there would be scope enough of handling that Science voluminously after a new manner; not only by teaching those things which tend to the perfection of vision, but also by determining mathematically all kinds of Phænomena of Colours which could be produced by refractions. For to do this, there is nothing else requisite than to find out the separations of heterogeneous rays, and their various mixtures and proportions in every mixture. By this way of arguing I invented almost all the Phænomena described in these Books, beside some others less necessary to the Argument; and by the successes I met with in the tryals, I dare promise, that to him who shall argue truly, and then try all things with good Glasses and sufficient circumspection, the expected event will not be wanting. But he is first to know what Colours will arise from any others mixt in any assigned Proportion.
PROP. IV. THEOR. III.
Colours may be produced by composition which shall be like to the Colours of homogeneal Light as to the appearance of Colour, but not as to the immutability of Colour and constitution of Light. And those Colours by how much they are more compounded by so much are they less full and intense, and by too much composition they may be <97> diluted and weakened till they cease. There may be also Colours produced by composition, which are not fully like any of the Colours of homogeneal Light.
For a mixture of homogeneal red and yellow compounds an orange, like in appearance of Colour to that orange which in the series of unmixed prismatick Colours lies between them; but the Light of one orange is homogeneal as to refrangibility, that of the other is heterogeneal, and the Colour of the one, if viewed through a Prism, remains unchanged, that of the other is changed and resolved into its component Colours red and yellow. And after the same manner other neighbouring homogeneal Colours may compound new Colours, like the intermediate homogeneal ones, as yellow and green, the Colour between them both, and afterwards, if blue be added, there will be made a green the middle Colour of the three which enter the composition. For the yellow and blue on either hand, if they are equal in quantity they draw the intermediate green equally towards themselves in composition, and so keep it as it were in equilibrio, that it verge not more to the yellow on the one hand, than to the blue on the other, but by their mixt actions remain still a middle Colour. To this mixed green there may be further added some red and violet, and yet the green will not presently cease but only grow less full and vivid, and by increasing the red and violet it will grow more and more dilute, until by the prevalence of the added Colours it be overcome and turned into whiteness, or some other Colour. So if to the Colour of any homogeneal Light, the Sun's white Light composed of all sorts of rays be <98> added, that Colour will not vanish or change its species but be diluted, and by adding more and more white it will be diluted more and more perpetually. Lastly, if red and violet be mingled, there will be generated according to their various Proportions various Purples, such as are not like in appearance to the Colour of any homogeneal Light, and of these Purples mixt with yellow and blue may be made other new Colours.
PROP. V. THEOR. IV.
Whiteness and all grey Colours between white and black, may be compounded of Colours, and the whiteness of the Sun's Light is compounded of all the primary Colours mixt in a due Proportion.
The Proof by Experiments.
EXPER. IX.
Sun shining into a dark Chamber through a little round Hole in the Window shut,[Image 6] and his Light being there refracted by a Prism to cast his coloured Image PT upon the opposite Wall: I held a white Paper V to that image in such manner that it might be illuminated by the coloured Light reflected from thence, and yet not intercept any part of that Light in its passage from the Prism to the Spectrum. And I found that when the Paper was held nearer to any Colour than to the rest, it appeared of that Colour to which it approached nearest; but when it was equally or almost <99> equally distant from all the Colours, so that it might be equally illuminated by them all it appeared white. And in this last situation of the Paper, if some Colours were intercepted, the Paper lost its white Colour, and appeared of the Colour of the rest of the Light which was not intercepted. So then the Paper was illuminated with Lights of various Colours, namely, red, yellow, green, blue and violet, and every part of the Light retained its proper Colour, until it was incident on the Paper, and became reflected thence to the Eye; so that if it had been either alone (the rest of the Light being intercepted) or if it had abounded most and been predominant in the Light reflected from the Paper, it would have tinged the Paper with its own Colour; and yet being mixed with the rest of the Colours in a due proportion, it made the Paper look white, and therefore by a composition with the rest produced that Colour. The several parts of the coloured Light reflected from the Spectrum, whilst they are propagated from thence thro' the Air, do perpetually retain their proper Colours, because wherever they fall upon the Eyes of any Spectator, they make the several parts of the Spectrum to appear under their proper Colours. They retain therefore their proper Colours when they fall upon the Paper V, and so by the confusion and perfect mixture of those Colours compound the whiteness of the Light reflected from thence.
EXPER. X.
Let that Spectrum or solar Image PT fall now upon the Lens MN above four Inches broad,[Image 7] and about six <100> Feet distant from the Prism ABC, and so figured that it may cause the coloured Light which divergeth from the Prism to converge and meet again at its Focus G, about six or eight Feet distant from the Lens, and there to fall perpendicularly upon a white Paper DE. And if you move this Paper to and fro, you will perceive that near the Lens, as at de, the whole solar Image (suppose at pt) will appear upon it intensely coloured after the manner above-explained, and that by receding from the Lens those Colours will perpetually come towards one another, and by mixing more and more dilute one another continually, until at length the Paper come to the Focus G, where by a perfect mixture they will wholly vanish and be converted into whiteness, the whole Light appearing now upon the Paper like a little white Circle. And afterwards by receding further from the Lens, the rays which before converged will now cross one another in the Focus G, and diverge from thence, and thereby make the Colours to appear again, but yet in a contrary order; suppose at δε, where the red t is now above which before was below, and the violet p is below which before was above.
Let us now stop the Paper at the Focus G where the Light appears totally white and circular, and let us consider its whiteness. I say, that this is composed of the converging Colours. For if any of those Colours be intercepted at the Lens, the whiteness will cease and degenerate into that Colour which ariseth from the composition of the other Colours which are not intercepted. And then if the intercepted Colours be let pass and fall upon that compound Colour, they mix with it, and by their mixture restore the whiteness. <101> So if the violet, blue and green be intercepted, the remaining yellow, orange and red will compound upon the Paper an orange, and then if the intercepted Colours be let pass they will fall upon this compounded orange, and together with it decompound a white. So also if the red and violet be intercepted, the remaining yellow, green and blue, will compound a green upon the Paper, and then the red and violet being let pass will fall upon this green, and together with it decompound a white. And that in this composition of white the several rays do not suffer any Change in their colorific qualities by acting upon one another, but are only mixed, and by a mixture of their Colours produce white, may further appear by these Arguments.
If the Paper be placed beyond the Focus G, suppose at δε, and then the red Colour at the Lens be alternately intercepted, and let pass again, the violet Colour on the Paper will not suffer any Change thereby, as it ought to do if the several sorts of rays acted upon one another in the Focus G, where they cross. Neither will the red upon the Paper be changed by any alternate stopping, and letting pass the violet which crosseth it.
And if the Paper be placed at the Focus G, and the white round Image at G be viewed through the Prism HIK, and by the refraction of that Prism be translated to the place rv, and there appear tinged with various Colours, namely, the violet at v and red at r, and others between, and then the red Colours at the Lens be often stopt and let pass by turns, the red at r will accordingly disappear and return as often, but the violet at v will not thereby suffer any change. And so by stopping and letting pass alternately the blue at the <102> Lens, the blue at r will accordingly disappear and return, without any change made in the red at r. The red therefore depends on one sort of rays, and the blue on another sort, which in the Focus G where they are commixt do not act on one another. And there is the same reason of the other Colours.
I considered further, that when the most refrangible rays Pp, and the least refrangible ones Tt, are by converging inclined to one another, the Paper, if held very oblique to those rays in the Focus G, might reflect one sort of them more copiously than the other sort, and by that means the reflected Light would be tinged in that Focus with the Colour of the predominant rays, provided those rays severally retained their Colours or colorific qualities in the composition of white made by them in that Focus. But if they did not retain them in that white, but became all of them severally endued there with a disposition to strike the sense with the perception of white, then they could never lose their whiteness by such reflexions. I inclined therefore the Paper to the rays very obliquely, as in the second Experiment of this Book, that the most refrangible rays might be more copiously reflected than the rest, and the whiteness at length changed successively into blue, indico and violet. Then I inclined it the contrary way, that the least refrangible rays might be more copious in the reflected Light than the rest, and the whiteness turned successively to yellow, orange and red.
Lastly, I made an Instrument XY in fashion of a Comb, whose Teeth being in number sixteen were about an Inch and a half broad, and the intervals of the Teeth about two Inches wide. Then by interposing <103> successively the Teeth of this Instrument near the Lens, I intercepted part of the Colours by the interposed Tooth, whilst the rest of them went on through the interval of the Teeth to the Paper DE, and there painted a round solar Image. But the Paper I had first placed so, that the Image might appear white as often as the Comb was taken away; and then the Comb being as was said interposed, that whiteness by reason of the intercepted part of the Colours at the Lens did always change into the Colour compounded of those Colours which were not intercepted, and that Colour was by the motion of the Comb perpetually varied so, that in the passing of every Tooth over the Lens all these Colours, red, yellow, green, blue and purple, did always succeed one another. I caused therefore all the Teeth to pass successively over the Lens, and when the motion was slow, there appeared a perpetual succession of the Colours upon the Paper: But if I so much accelerated the motion, that the Colours by reason of their quick succession could not be distinguished from one another, the appearance of the single Colours ceased. There was no red, no yellow, no green, no blue, nor purple to be seen any longer, but from a confusion of them all there arose one uniform white Colour. Of the Light which now by the mixture of all the Colours appeared white, there was no part really white. One part was red, another yellow, a third green, a fourth blue, a fifth purple, and every part retains its proper Colour till it strike the Sensorium. If the impressions follow one another slowly, so that they may be severally perceived, there is made a distinct sensation of all the Colours one after another in a continual succession. <104> But if the impressions follow one another so quickly that they cannot be severally perceived, there ariseth out of them all one common sensation, which is neither of this Colour alone nor of that alone, but hath it self indifferently to 'em all, and this is a sensation of Whiteness. By the quickness of the successions the impressions of the several Colours are confounded in the Sensorium, and out of that confusion ariseth a mixt sensation. If a burning Coal be nimbly moved round in a Circle with Gyrations continually repeated, the whole Circle will appear like Fire; the reason of which is, that the sensation of the Coal in the several places of that Circle remains imprest on the Sensorium, until the Coal return again to the same place. And so in a quick consecution of the Colours the impression of every Colour remains in the Sensorium, until a revolution of all the Colours be compleated, and that first Colour return again. The impressions therefore of all the successive Colours are at once in the Sensorium, and joyntly stir up a sensation of them all; and so it is manifest by this Experiment, that the commixt impressions of all the Colours do stir up and beget a sensation of white, that is, that whiteness is compounded of all the Colours.
And if the Comb be now taken away, that all the Colours may at once pass from the Lens to the Paper, and be there intermixed, and together reflected thence to the Spectator's Eyes; their impressions on the Sensorium being now more subtily and perfectly commixed there, ought much more to stir up a sensation of whiteness.
<105>
You may instead of the Lens use two Prisms HIK and LMN, which by refracting the coloured Light the contrary way to that of the first refraction, may make the diverging rays converge and meet again in G, as you see represented in the seventh Figure.[Image 8] For where they meet and mix they will compose a white Light as when a Lens is used.
EXPER. XI.
Let the Sun's coloured Image PT fall upon the Wall of a dark Chamber,[Image 9] as in the third Experiment of the first Book, and let the same be viewed through a Prism abc, held parallel to the Prism ABC, by whose refraction that Image was made, and let it now appear lower than before, suppose in the place S over against the red Colour T. And if you go near to the Image PT, the Spectrum S will appear oblong and coloured like the Image PT; but if you recede from it, the Colours of the spectrum S will be contracted more and more, and at length vanish, that Spectrum S becoming perfectly round and white; and if you recede yet further, the Colours will emerge again, but in a contrary Order. Now that Spectrum S appears white in that case when the rays of several sorts which converge from the several parts of the Image PT, to the Prism abc, are so refracted unequally by it, that in their passage from the Prism to the Eye they may diverge from one and the same point of the Spectrum S, and so fall afterwards upon one and the same point in the bottom of the Eye, and there be mingled.
<106>
And further, if the Comb be here made use of, by whose Teeth the Colours at the Image PT may be successively intercepted; the Spectrum S when the Comb is moved slowly will be perpetually tinged with successive Colours: But when by accelerating the motion of the Comb, the succession of the Colours is so quick that they cannot be severally seen, that Spectrum S, by a confused and mixt sensation of them all, will appear white.
EXPER. XII.
The Sun shining through a large Prism ABC upon a Comb XY,[Image 10] placed immediately behind the Prism, his Light which passed through the interstices of the Teeth fell upon a white Paper DE. The breadths of the Teeth were equal to their interstices, and seven Teeth together with their Interstices took up an Inch in breadth. Now when the Paper was about two or three Inches distant from the Comb, the Light which passed through its several interstices painted so many ranges of Colours, kl, mn, op, qr, &c. which were parallel to one another and contiguous, and without any mixture of white. And these ranges of Colours, if the Comb was moved continually up and down with a reciprocal motion ascended and descended in the Paper, and when the motion of the Comb was so quick, that the Colours could not be distinguished from one another, the whole Paper by their confusion and mixture in the Sensorium appeared white.
<107>
Let the Comb now rest, and let the Paper be removed further from the Prism, and the several ranges of Colours will be dilated and expanded into one another more and more, and by mixing their Colours will dilute one another, and at length, when the distance of the Paper from the Comb is about a Foot, or a little more (suppose in the place 2D2E) they will so far dilute one another as to become white.
With any Obstacle let all the Light be now stopt which passes through any one interval of the Teeth, so that the range of Colours which comes from thence may be taken away, and you will see the Light of the rest of the ranges to be expanded into the place of the range taken away, and there to be coloured. Let the intercepted range pass on as before, and its Colours falling upon the Colours of the other ranges, and mixing with them, will restore the whiteness.
Let the Paper 2D2E be now very much inclined to the rays, so that the most refrangible rays may be more copiously reflected than the rest, and the white Colour of the Paper through the excess of those rays will be changed into blue and violet. Let the Paper be as much inclined the contrary way, that the least refrangible rays may be now more copiously reflected than the rest, and by their excess the whiteness will be changed into yellow and red. The several rays therefore in that white Light do retain their colorific qualities, by which those of any sort, when-ever they become more copious than the rest, do by their excess and predominance cause their proper Colour to appear.
<108>
And by the same way of arguing, applied to the third Experiment of this Book, it may be concluded, that the white Colour of all refracted Light at its very first emergence, where it appears as white as before its incidence, is compounded of various Colours.
EXPER. XIII.
In the foregoing Experiment the several intervals of the Teeth of the Comb do the office of so many Prisms, every interval producing the Phænomenon of one Prism. Whence instead of those intervals using several Prisms, I try'd to compound whiteness by mixing their Colours, and did it by using only three Prisms, as also by using only two as follows. Let two Prisms ABC and abc,[Image 11] whose refracting Angles B and b are equal, be so placed parallel to one another, that the refracting Angle B of the one may touch the Angle c at the base of the other, and their Planes CB and cb, at which the rays emerge, may lye in directum. Then let the Light trajected through them fall upon the Paper MN, distant about 8 or 12 Inches from the Prisms. And the Colours generated by the interior Limits B and c of the two Prisms, will be mingled at PT, and there compound white. For if either Prism be taken away, the Colours made by the other will appear in that Place PT, and when the Prism is restored to its place again, so that its Colours may there fall upon the Colours of the other, the mixture of them both will restore the whiteness.
<109>
This Experiment succeeds also, as I have tryed, when the Angle b of the lower Prism, is a little greater than the Angle B of the upper, and between the interior Angles B and c, there intercedes some space Bc, as is represented in the Figure, and the refracting planes BC and bc, are neither in directum, nor parallel to one another. For there is nothing more requisite to the success of this Experiment, than that the rays of all sorts may be uniformly mixed upon the Paper in the place PT. If the most refrangible rays coming from the superior Prism take up all the space from M to P, the rays of the same sort which come from the inferior Prism ought to begin at P, and take up all the rest of the space from thence towards N. If the least refrangible rays coming from the superior Prism take up the space MT, the rays of the same kind which come from the other Prism ought to begin at T, and take up the remaining space TN. If one sort of the rays which have intermediate degrees of refrangibility, and come from the superior Prism be extended through the space MQ, and another sort of those rays through the space MR, and a third sort of them through the space MS, the same sorts of rays coming from the lower Prism, ought to illuminate the remaining spaces QN, RN, SN respectively. And the same is to be understood of all the other sorts of rays. For thus the rays of every sort will be scattered uniformly and evenly through the whole space MN, and so being every where mixt in the same proportion, they must every where produce the same Colour. And therefore since by this mixture they produce white in the exterior spaces MP and TN, they must also produce white in the interior space PT. This <110> is the reason of the composition by which whiteness was produced in this Experiment, and by what other way soever I made the like composition the result was whiteness.
Lastly, If with the Teeth of a Comb of a due size, the coloured Lights of the two Prisms which fall upon the space PT be alternately intercepted, that Space PT, when the motion of the Comb is slow, will always appear coloured, but by accelerating the motion of the Comb so much, that the successive Colours cannot be distinguished from one another, it will appear white.
EXPER. XIV.
Hitherto I have produced whiteness by mixing the Colours of Prisms. If now the Colours of natural Bodies are to be mingled, let Water a little thickened with Soap be agitated to raise a froth, and after that froth has stood a little, there will appear to one that shall view it intently various Colours every where in the surfaces of the several Bubbles; but to one that shall go so far off that he cannot distinguish the Colours from one another, the whole froth will grow white with a perfect whiteness.
EXPER. XV.
Lastly, in attempting to compound a white by mixing the coloured Powders which Painters use, I considered that all coloured Powders do suppress and stop in them a very considerable part of the Light by which <111> they are illuminated. For they become coloured by reflecting the Light of their own Colours more copiously, and that of all other Colours more sparingly, and yet they do not reflect the Light of their own Colours so copiously as white Bodies do. If red Lead, for instance, and a white Paper, be placed in the red Light of the coloured Spectrum made in a dark Chamber by the refraction of a Prism, as is described in the third Experiment of the first Book; the Paper will appear more lucid than the red Lead, and therefore reflects the red-making rays more copiously than red Lead doth. And if they be held in the Light of any other Colour, the Light reflected by the Paper will exceed the Light reflected by the red Lead in a much greater proportion. And the like happens in Powders of other Colours. And therefore by mixing such Powders we are not to expect a strong and full white, such as is that of Paper, but some dusky obscure one, such as might arise from a mixture of light and darkness, or from white and black, that is, a grey, or dun, or russet brown, such as are the Colours of a Man's Nail, of a Mouse, of Ashes, of ordinary Stones, of Mortar, of Dust and Dirt in High-ways, and the like. And such a dark white I have often produced by mixing coloured Powders. For thus one part of red Lead, and five parts of Viride Æris, composed a dun Colour like that of a Mouse. For these two Colours were severally so compounded of others, that in both together were a mixture of all Colours; and there was less red Lead used than Viride Æris, because of the fulness of its Colour. Again, one part of red Lead, and four parts of blue Bise, composed a dun Colour verging a little to purple, and by adding to this a <112> certain mixture of Orpiment and Viride Æris in a due proportion, the mixture lost its purple tincture, and became perfectly dun. But the Experiment succeeded best without Minium thus. To Orpiment I added by little and little a certain full bright purple, which Painters use until the Orpiment ceased to be yellow, and became of a pale red. Then I diluted that red by adding a little Viride Æris, and a little more blue Bise than Viride Æris, until it became of such a grey or pale white, as verged to no one of the Colours more than to another. For thus it became of a Colour equal in whiteness to that of Ashes or of Wood newly cut, or of a Man's Skin. The Orpiment reflected more Light than did any other of the Powders, and therefore conduced more to the whiteness of the compounded Colour than they. To assign the proportions accurately may be difficult, by reason of the different goodness of Powders of the same kind. Accordingly as the Colour of any Powder is more or less full and luminous, it ought to be used in a less or greater proportion.
Now considering that these grey and dun Colours may be also produced by mixing whites and blacks, and by consequence differ from perfect whites not in species of Colours but only in degree of luminousness, it is manifest that there is nothing more requisite to make them perfectly white than to increase their Light sufficiently; and, on the contrary, if by increasing their Light they can be brought to perfect whiteness, it will thence also follow, that they are of the same Species of Colour with the best whites, and differ from them only in the quantity of Light. And this I tried as follows. I took the third of the above-mentioned grey mixtures <113> (that which was compounded of Orpiment, Purple, Bise, and Viride Æris) and rubbed it thickly upon the floor of my Chamber, where the Sun shone upon it through the opened Casement; and by it, in the shadow, I laid a piece of white Paper of the same bigness. Then going from them to the distance of 12 or 18 Feet, so that I could not discern the uneavenness of the surface of the Powder, nor the little shadows let fall from the gritty particles thereof; the Powder appeared intensely white, so as to transcend even the Paper it self in whiteness, especially if the Paper were a little shaded from the Light of the Clouds, and then the Paper compared with the Powder appeared of such a grey Colour as the Powder had done before. But by laying the Paper where the Sun shines through the Glass of the Window, or by shutting the Window that the Sun might shine through the Glass upon the Powder, and by such other fit means of increasing or decreasing the Lights wherewith the Powder and Paper were illuminated, the Light wherewith the Powder is illuminated may be made stronger in such a due proportion than the Light wherewith the Paper is illuminated, that they shall both appear exactly alike in whiteness. For when I was trying this, a Friend coming to visit me, I stopt him at the door, and before I told him what the Colours were, or what I was doing; I askt him, Which of the two whites were the best, and wherein they differed? And after he had at that distance viewed them well, he answered, That they were both good whites, and that he could not say which was best, nor wherein their Colours differed. Now if you consider, that this white of the Powder in the Sun-shine was compounded of the <114> Colours which the component Powders (Orpiment, Purple, Bise, and Viride Æris) have in the same Sun-shine, you must acknowledge by this Experiment, as well as by the former, that perfect whiteness may be compounded of Colours.
From what has been said it is also evident, that the whiteness of the Sun's Light is compounded of all the Colours wherewith the several sorts of rays whereof that Light consists, when by their several refrangibilities they are separated from one another, do tinge Paper or any other white Body whereon they fall. For those Colours by Prop. 2. are unchangeable, and whenever all those rays with those their Colours are mixt again, they reproduce the same white Light as before.
PROP. VI. PROB. II.
In a mixture of primary Colours, the quantity and quality of each being given, to know the Colour of the compound.
With the Center O and Radius OD describe a Circle ADF,[Image 12] and distinguish its circumference into seven parts DE, EF, FG, GA, AB, BC, CD, proportional to the seven musical Tones or Intervals of the eight Sounds, Sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, contained in an Eight, that is, proportional to the numbers , , {}, , , , {}. Let the first Part DE represent a red Colour, the second EF orange, the third FG yellow, the fourth GH green, the fifth AB blue, the sixth BC indico, and the seventh CD violet. And conceive that these are all the Colours of uncompounded Light gradually <115> passing into one another, as they do when made by Prisms; the circumference DEFGABCD, representing the whole series of Colours from one end of the Sun's coloured Image to the other, so that from D to E be all degrees of red, at E the mean Colour between red and orange, from E to F all degrees of orange, at F the mean between orange and yellow, from F to G all degrees of yellow, and so on. Let p be the center of gravity of the Arch DE, and q, r, s, t, v, x, the centers of gravity of the Arches EF, FG, GA, AB, BC and CD respectively, and about those centers of gravity let Circles proportional to the number of rays of each Colour in the given mixture be described; that is, the Circle p proportional to the number of the red-making rays in the mixture, the Circle q proportional to the number of the orange-making rays in the mixture, and so of the rest. Find the common center of gravity of all those Circles p, q, r, s, t, v, x. Let that center be Z; and from the center of the Circle ADF, through Z to the circumference, drawing the right Line OY, the place of the Point Y in the circumference shall shew the Colour arising from the composition of all the Colours in the given mixture, and the Line OZ shall be proportional to the fulness or intenseness of the Colour, that is, to its distance from whiteness. As if Y fall in the middle between F and G, the compounded Colour shall be the best yellow; if Y verge from the middle towards F or G, the compounded Colour shall accordingly be a yellow, verging towards orange or green. If Z fall upon the circumference the Colour shall be intense and florid in the highest degree; if it fall in the mid way between the circumference and center, it shall be <116> but half so intense, that is, it shall be such a Colour as would be made by diluting the intensest yellow with an equal quantity of whiteness; and if it fall upon the center O, the Colour shall have lost all its intenseness, and become a white. But it is to be noted, That if the point Z fall in or near the line OD, the main ingredients being the red and violet, the Colour compounded shall not be any of the prismatic Colours, but a purple, inclining to red or violet, accordingly as the point Z lieth on the side of the line DO towards E or towards C, and in general the compounded violet is more bright and more fiery than the uncompounded. Also if only two of the primary Colours which in the circle are opposite to one another be mixed in an equal proportion, the point Z shall fall upon the center O, and yet the Colour compounded of those two shall not be perfectly white, but some faint anonymous Colour. For I could never yet by mixing only two primary Colours produce a perfect white. Whether it may be compounded of a mixture of three taken at equal distances in the circumference I do not know, but of four or five I do not much question but it may. But these are curiosities of little or no moment to the understanding the Phænomena of nature. For in all whites produced by nature, there uses to be a mixture of all sorts of rays, and by consequence a composition of all Colours.
To give an instance of this Rule; suppose a Colour is compounded of these homogeneal Colours, of violet 1 part, of indico 1 part, of blue 2 parts, of green 3 parts, of yellow 5 parts, of orange 6 parts, and of red 10 parts. Proportional to these parts describe the Circles x, v, t, s, r, q, p respectively, that is, so that if the Circle x <117> be 1, the Circle v may be 1, the Circle t 2, the Circle s 3, and the Circles r, q and p, 5, 6 and 10. Then I find Z the common center of gravity of these Circles, and through Z drawing the line OY, the point Y falls upon the circumference between E and F, some thing nearer to E than to F, and thence I conclude, that the Colour compounded of these ingredients will be an orange, verging a little more to red than to yellow. Also I find that OZ is a little less than one half of OY, and thence I conclude, that this orange hath a little less than half the fulness or intenseness of an uncompounded orange; that is to say, that it is such an orange as may be made by mixing an homogeneal orange with a good white in the proportion of the line OZ to the line ZY, this proportion being not of the quantities of mixed orange and white powders, but of the quantities of the lights reflected from them.
This Rule I conceive accurate enough for practice, though not mathematically accurate; and the truth of it may be sufficiently proved to sense, by stopping any of the Colours at the Lens in the tenth Experiment of this Book. For the rest of the Colours which are not stopped, but pass on to the Focus of the Lens, will there compound either accurately or very nearly such a Colour as by this Rule ought to result from their mixture.

All the Colours in the Universe which are made by Light, and depend not on the power of imagination, are either the Colours of homogeneal Lights, or compounded of these and that either accurately or very nearly, according to the Rule of the foregoing Problem.
For it has been proved (in Prop. 1. Lib. 2.) that the changes of Colours made by refractions do not arise from any new modifications of the rays imprest by those refractions, and by the various terminations of light and shadow, as has been the constant and general opinion of Philosophers. It has also been proved that the several Colours of the homogeneal rays do constantly answer to their degrees of refrangibility, (Prop. 1. Lib. 1. and Prop. 2. Lib. 2.) and that their degrees of refrangibility cannot be changed by refractions and reflexions, (Prop. 2. Lib. 1.) and by consequence that those their Colours are likewise immutable. It has also been proved directly by refracting and reflecting homogeneal Lights apart, that their Colours cannot be changed, Prop. 2. Lib. 2.) It has been proved also, that when the several sorts of rays are mixed, and in crossing pass through the same space, they do not act on one another so as to change each others colorifick qualities, (Exper. 10. Lib. 2.) but by mixing their actions in the Sensorium beget a sensation differing from what either would do apart, that is a sensation of a mean Colour between their proper Colours; and particularly when by the concourse and mixtures of all sorts of rays, a white <119> Colour is produced, the white is a mixture of all the Colours which the rays would have apart, (Prop. 5. Lib 2.) The rays in that mixture do not lose or alter their several colorifick qualities, but by all their various kinds of actions mixt in the Sensorium, beget a sensation of a middling Colour between all their Colours which is whiteness. For whiteness is a mean between all Colours, having it self indifferently to them all, so as with equal facility to be tinged with any of them. A red Powder mixed with a little blue, or a blue with a little red, doth not presently lose its Colour, but a white Powder mixed with any Colour is presently tinged with that Colour, and is equally capable of being tinged with any Colour what-ever. It has been shewed also, that as the Sun's Light is mixed of all sorts of rays, so its whiteness is a mixture of the Colours of all sorts of rays; those rays having from the beginning their several colorific qualities as well as their several refrangibilities, and retaining them perpetually unchang'd notwithstanding any refractions or reflexions they may at any time suffer, and that when-ever any sort of the Sun's rays is by any means (as by reflexion in Exper. 9 and 10. Lib. 1. or by refraction as happens in all refractions) separated from the rest, they then manifest their proper Colours. These things have been proved, and the sum of all this amounts to the Proposition here to be proved. For if the Sun's Light is mixed of several sorts of rays, each of which have originally their several refrangibilities and colorifick qualities, and notwithstanding their refractions and reflexions, and their various separations or mixtures, keep those their original properties perpetually the same without altera <120> tion; then all the Colours in the World must be such as constantly ought to arise from the original colorific qualities of the rays whereof the Lights consist by which those Colours are seen. And therefore if the reason of any Colour what-ever be required, we have nothing else to do than to consider how the rays in the Sun's Light have by reflexions or refractions, or other causes been parted from one another, or mixed together; or otherwise to find out what sorts of rays are in the Light by which that Colour is made, and in what proportion; and then by the last Problem to learn the Colour which ought to arise by mixing those rays (or their Colours) in that proportion. I speak here of Colours so far as they arise from Light. For they appear sometimes by other causes, as when by the power of phantasy we see Colours in a Dream, or a mad Man sees things before him which are not there; or when we see Fire by striking the Eye, or see Colours like the Eye of a Peacock's Feather, by pressing our Eyes in either corner whilst we look the other way. Where these and such like causes interpose not, the Colour always answers to the sort or sorts of the rays whereof the Light consists, as I have constantly found in what-ever Phænomena of Colours I have hitherto been able to examine. I shall in the following Propositions give instances of this in the Phænomena of chiefest note.
<121>
PROP. VIII. PROB. III.
By the discovered Properties of Light to explain the Colours made by Prisms.
Let ABC represent a Prism refracting the Light of the Sun,[Image 13] which comes into a dark Chamber through a Hole Fφ almost as broad as the Prism, and let MN represent a white Paper on which the refracted Light is cast, and suppose the most refrangible or deepest violet making rays fall upon the space Pπ, the least refrangible or deepest red-making rays upon the space Tτ, the middle sort between the Indico-making and blue-making rays upon the space Qχ, the middle sort of the green-making rays upon the space Rρ, the middle sort between the yellow-making and orange-making rays upon the space Sσ, and other intermediate sorts upon intermediate spaces. For so the spaces upon which the several sorts adequately fall will by reason of the different refrangibility of those sorts be one lower than another. Now if the Paper MN be so near the Prism that the spaces PT and πτ do not interfere with one another, the distance between them Tπ will be illuminated by all the sorts of rays in that proportion to one another which they have at their very first coming out of the Prism, and consequently be white. But the spaces PT and πτ on either hand, will not be illuminated by them all, and therefore will appear coloured. And particularly at P, where the outmost violet-making rays fall alone, the Colour must be the deepest violet. At Q where the violet-making and indico-making rays are mixed, it <122> must be a violet inclining much to indico. At R where the violet-making, indico-making, blue-making, and one half of the green-making rays are mixed, their Colours must (by the construction of the second Problem) compound a middle Colour between indico and blue. At S where all the rays are mixed except the red-making and orange-making, their Colours ought by the same Rule to compound a faint blue, verging more to green than indie. And in the progress from S to T, this blue will grow more and more faint and dilute, till at T, where all the Colours begin to be mixed, it end in whiteness.
So again, on the other side of the white at T, where the least refrangible or utmost red-making rays are alone the Colour must be the deepest red. At σ the mixture of red and orange will compound a red inclining to orange. At ρ the mixture of red, orange, yellow, and one half of the green must compound a middle Colour between orange and yellow. At χ the mixture of all Colours but violet and indico will compound a faint yellow, verging more to green than to orange. And this yellow will grow more faint and dilute continually in its progress from χ to π, where by a mixture of all sorts of rays it will become white.
These Colours ought to appear were the Sun's Light perfectly white: But because it inclines to yellow, the excess of the yellow-making rays whereby 'tis tinged with that Colour, being mixed with the faint blue between S and T, will draw it to a faint green. And so the Colours in order from P to T ought to be violet, indico, blue, very faint green, white, faint yellow, orange, red. Thus it is by the computation: And they that please to <123> view the Colours made by a Prism will find it so in Nature.
These are the Colours on both sides the white when the Paper is held between the Prism, and the Point X where the Colours meet, and the interjacent white vanishes. For if the Paper be held still farther off from the Prism, the most refrangible and least refrangible rays will be wanting in the middle of the Light, and the rest of the rays which are found there, will by mixture produce a fuller green than before. Also the yellow and blue will now become less compounded, and by consequence more intense than before. And this also agrees with experience.
And if one look through a Prism upon a white Object encompassed with blackness or darkness, the reason of the Colours arising on the edges is much the same, as will appear to one that shall a little consider it. If a black Object be encompassed with a white one, the Colours which appear through the Prism are to be derived from the Light of the white one, spreading into the Regions of the black, and therefore they appear in a contrary order to that, in which they appear when a white Object is surrounded with black. And the same is to be understood when an Object is viewed, whose parts are some of them less luminous than others. For in the Borders of the more and less luminous parts, Colours ought always by the same Principles to arise from the excess of the Light of the more luminous, and to be of the same kind as if the darker parts were black, but yet to be more faint and dilute.
<124>
What is said of Colours made by Prisms may be easily applied to Colours made by the Glasses of Telescopes, or Microscopes, or by the humours of the Eye. For if the Object-glass of a Telescope be thicker on one side than on the other, or if one half of the Glass, or one half of the Pupil of the Eye be covered with any opake substance: the Object-glass, or that part of it or of the Eye which is not covered, may be considered as a Wedge with crooked sides, and every Wedge of Glass or other pellucid substance has the effect of a Prism in refracting the Light which passes through it.
How the Colours in the 9th and 10th Experiments of the first Part arise from the different reflexibility of Light, is evident by what was there said. But it is observable in the 9th Experiment, that whilst the Sun's direct Light is yellow, the excess of the blue-making rays in the reflected Beam of Light MN, suffices only to bring that yellow to a pale white inclining to blue, and not to tinge it with a manifestly blue Colour. To obtain therefore a better blue, I used instead of the yellow Light of the Sun the white Light of the Clouds, by varying a little the Experiment as follows.
EXPER. XVI.
Let HFG represent a Prism in the open Air, and S the Eye of the Spectator,[Image 14] viewing the Clouds by their Light coming into the Prism at the plane side FIGK, and reflected in it by its base HEIG, and thence going out through its plane side HEFK to the Eye. And when the Prism and Eye are conveniently placed, so that the Angles of incidence and reflexion at the base <125> may be about 40 degrees, the Spectator will see a Bow MN of a blue Colour, running from one end of the base to the other, with the concave side towards him, and the part of the base IMNG beyond this Bow will be brighter than the other part EMNH on the other side of it. This blue Colour MN being made by nothing else than by reflexion of a specular superficies, seems so odd a Phænomenon, and so unaccountable for by the vulgar Hypothesis of Philosophers, that I could not but think it deserved to be taken notice of. Now for understanding the reason of it, suppose the plane ABC to cut the plane sides and base of the Prism perpendicularly. From the Eye to the Line BC, wherein that plane cuts the base, draw the Lines Sp and St, in the Angles Spc 50 degr. , and Stc 49 degr. , and the point p will be the limit beyond which none of the most refrangible rays can pass through the base of the Prism, and be refracted, whose incidence is such that they may be reflected to the Eye; and the Point t will be the like limit for the least refrangible rays, that is, beyond which none of them can pass through the base, whose incidence is such that by reflexion they may come to the Eye. And the Point r taken in the middle Way between p and t, will be the like limit for the meanly refrangible rays. And therefore all the least refrangible rays which fall upon the base beyond t, that is, between t and B, and can come from thence to the Eye will be reflected thither: But on this side t, that is, between t and c, many of these rays will be transmitted through the base. And all the most refrangible rays which fall upon the base beyond p, that is, between p and B, and can by reflexion come from thence to the Eye, will be reflected <126> thither, but every where between t and c, many of these rays will get through the base and be refracted; and the same is to be understood of the meanly refrangible rays on either side of the Point r. Whence it follows, that the base of the Prism must every where between t and B, by a total reflexion of all sorts of rays to the Eye, look white and bright. And every where between p and C, by reason of the transmission of many rays of every sort, look more pale, obscure and dark. But at r, and in other Places between p and t, where all the more refrangible rays are reflected to the Eye, and many of the less refrangible are transmitted, the excess of the most refrangible in the reflected Light will tinge that Light with their Colour, which is violet and blue. And this happens by taking the line CprtB any where between the ends of the Prism HG and EI.
PROP. IX. PROB. IV.
By the discovered Properties of Light to explain the Colours of the Rain-bow.
This Bow never appears but where it rains in the Sun-shine, and may be made artificially by spouting up Water which may break aloft, and scatter into Drops, and fall down like Rain. For the Sun shining upon these Drops certainly causes the Bow to appear to a Spectator standing in a due position to the Rain and Sun. And hence it is now agreed upon, that this Bow is made by refraction of the Sun's Light in Drops of falling Rain. This was understood by some of the Ancients, and of late more fully discovered and explained by the Famous <127> Antonius de Dominis Archbishop of Spilato, in his Book De Radiis Visus & Lucis, published by his Friend Bartolus at Venice, in the Year 1611, and written above twenty Years before. For he teaches there how the interior Bow is made in round Drops of Rain by two refractions of the Sun's Light, and one reflexion between them, and the exterior by two refractions and two sorts of reflexions between them in each Drop of Water, and proves his Explications by Experiments made with a Phial full of Water, and with Globes of Glass filled with Water, and placed in the Sun to make the Colours of the two Bows appear in them. The same Explication Des-Cartes hath pursued in his Meteors, and mended that of the exterior Bow. But whilst they understood not the true Origin of Colours, it's necessary to pursue it here a little further. For understanding therefore how the Bow is made, let a Drop of Rain, or any other spherical transparent Body be represented by the Sphere BNFG,[Image 15] described with the Center C, and Semi-diameter CN. And let AN be one of the Sun's rays incident upon it at N, and thence refracted to F, where let it either go out of the Sphere by refraction towards V, or be reflected to G; and at G let it either go out by refraction to R, or be reflected to H; and at H let it go out by refraction towards S, cutting the incident ray in Y; produce AN and RG, till they meet in X, and upon AX and NF let fall the perpendiculars CD and CE, and produce CD till it fall upon th circumference at L. Parallel to the incident ray AN draw the Diameter BQ, and let the sine of incidence out of Air into Water be to the sine of refraction as I to R. Now if you suppose the point of incidence N to <128> move from the Point B, continually till it come to L, the Arch QF will first increase and then decrease, and so will the Angle AXR which the rays AN and GR contain; and the Arch QF and Angle AXR will be biggest when ND is to CN as  to , in which case NE will be to ND as 2R to I. Also the Angle AYS which the rays AN and HS contain will first decrease, and then increase and grow least when ND is to CN as  to , in which case NE will be to ND, as 3R to I. And so the Angle which the next emergent ray (that is, the emergent ray after three reflexions) contains with the incident ray AN will come to its limit when ND is to CN as  to , in which case NE will be to ND as 4R to I. And the Angle which the ray next after that emergent, that is, the ray emergent after four reflexions, contains with the incident will come to its limit, when ND is to CN as  to , in which case NE will be to ND as 5R to I; and so on infinitely, the Numbers 3, 8, 15, 24, &c. being gathered by continual addition of the terms of the arithmetical progression 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. The truth of all this Mathematicians will easily examine.
Now it is to be observed, that as when the Sun comes to his Tropicks, days increase and decrease but a very little for a great while together; so when by increasing the distance CD, these Angles come to their limits, they vary their quantity but very little for some time together, and therefore a far greater number of the rays which fall upon all the points N in the Quadrant BL, shall emerge in the limits of these Angles, then in any other inclinations. And further it is <129> to be observed, that the rays which differ in refrangibility will have different limits of their Angles of emergence, and by consequence according to their different degrees of refrangibility emerge most copiously in different Angles, and being separated from one another appear each in their proper Colours. And what those Angles are may be easily gathered from the foregoing Theorem by computation.
For in the least refrangible rays the sines I and R (as was found above) are 108 and 81, and thence by computation the greatest Angle AXR will be found 42 degrees and 2 minutes, and the least Angle AYS, 50 degr. and 57 minutes. And in the most refrangible rays the sines I and R are 109 and 81, and thence by computation the greatest Angle AXR will be found 40 degrees and 17 minutes, and the least Angle AYS 54 degrees and 7 minutes.
Suppose now that O is the Spectator's Eye,[Image 16] and OP a line drawn parallel to the Sun's rays, and let POE, POF, POG, POH, be Angles of 40 degr. 17 min. 42 degr. 2 min. 50 degr. 57 min. and 54 degr. 7 min. respectively, and these Angles turned about their common side OP, shall with their other sides OE, OF; OG, OH describe the verges of two Rain-bows AFBE and CHDG. For if E, F, G, H, be Drops placed any where in the conical superficies described by OE, OF, OG, OH, and be illuminated by the Sun's rays SE, SF, SG, SH; the Angle SEO being equal to the Angle POE or 40 degr. 17 min. shall be the greatest Angle in which the most refrangible rays can after one reflexion be refracted to the Eye, and therefore all the Drops in the line OE shall send the most refrangible <130> rays most copiously to the Eye, and thereby strike the senses with the deepest violet Colour in that region. And in like manner the Angle SFO being equal to the Angle POF, or 42 degr. 2 min. shall be the greatest in which the least refrangible rays after one reflexion can emerge out of the Drops, and therefore those rays shall come most copiously to the Eye from the Drops in the line OF, and strike the senses with the deepest red Colour in that region. And by the same argument, the rays which have intermediate degrees of refrangibility shall come most copiously from Drops between E and F, and strike the senses with the intermediate Colours in the order which their degrees of refrangibility require, that is, in the progress from E to F, or from the inside of the Bow to the outside in this order, violet, indico, blue, green, yellow, orange, red. But the violet, by the mixture of the white Light of the Clouds, will appear faint and incline to purple.
Again, the Angle SGO being equal to the Angle POG, or 50 gr. 51 min. shall be the least Angle in which the least refrangible rays can after two reflexions emerge out of the Drops, and therefore the least refrangible rays shall come most copiously to the Eye from the Drops in the line OG, and strike the sense with the deepest red in that region. And the Angle SHO being equal to the Angle POH or 54 gr. 7 min. shall be the least Angle in which the most refrangible rays after two reflexions can emerge out of the Drops, and therefore those rays shall come most copiously to the Eye from the Drops in the line OH, and strike the senses with the deepest violet in that region. And by the same argument, the Drops in the regions between G and H shall strike the sense with <131> the intermediate Colours in the order which their degrees of refrangibility require, that is, in the progress from G to H, or from the inside of the Bow to the outside in this order, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indico, violet. And since these four lines OE, OF, OG, OH, may be situated any where in the above-mentioned conical superficies, what is said of the Drops and Colours in these lines is to be understood of the Drops and Colours every where in those superficies.
Thus shall there be made two Bows of Colours, an interior and stronger, by one reflexion in the Drops, and an exterior and fainter by two; for the Light becomes fainter by every reflexion. And their Colours shall ly in a contrary order to one another, the red of both Bows bordering upon the space GF which is between the Bows. The breadth of the interior Bow EOF measured cross the Colours shall be 1 degr. 45 min. and the breadth of the exterior GOH shall be 3 degr. 10 min. and the distance between them GOF shall be 8 gr. 15 min. the greatest Semi-diameter of the innermost, that is, the Angle POF being 42 gr. 2 min. and the least Semi-diameter of the outermost POG, being 50 gr. 57 min. These are the measures of the Bows, as they would be were the Sun but a point; for by the breadth of his Body the breadth of the Bows will be increased and their distance decreased by half a degree, and so the breadth of the interior Iris will be 2 degr. 15 min. that of the exterior 3 degr. 40 min. their distance 8 degr. 25 min. the greatest Semi-diameter of the interior Bow 42 degr. 17 min. and the least of the exterior 50 degr. 42 min. And such are the dimensions of the Bows in the Heavens found to be very nearly, <132> when their Colours appear strong and perfect. For once, by such means as I then had, I measured the greatest Semi-diameter of the interior Iris about 42 degrees, the breadth of the red, yellow and green in that Iris 63 or 64 minutes, besides the outmost faint red obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, for which we may allow 3 or 4 minutes more. The breadth of the blue was about 40 minutes more besides the violet, which was so much obscured by the brightness of the Clouds, that I could not measure its breadth. But supposing the breadth of the blue and violet together to equal that of the red, yellow and green together, the whole breadth of this Iris will be about  degrees as above. The least distance between this Iris and the exterior Iris was about 8 degrees and 30 minutes. The exterior Iris was broader than the interior, but so faint, especially on the blue side, that I could not measure its breadth distinctly. At another time when both Bows appeared more distinct, I measured the breadth of the interior Iris 2 gr. 10′, and the breadth of the red, yellow and green in the exterior Iris, was to the breadth of the same Colours in the interior as 3 to 2.
This Explication of the Rain-bow is yet further confirmed by the known Experiment (made by Antonius de Dominis and Des-Cartes) of hanging up any where in the Sun-shine a Glass-Globe filled with Water, and viewing it in such a posture that the rays which come from the Globe to the Eye may contain with the Sun's rays an Angle of either 42 or 50 degrees. For if the Angle be about 42 or 43 degrees, the Spectator (suppose at O) shall see a full red Colour in that side of the Globe opposed to the Sun as 'tis represented at F, and <133> if that Angle become less (suppose by depressing the Globe to E) there will appear other Colours, yellow, green and blue successively in the same side of the Globe. But if the Angle be made about 50 degrees (suppose by lifting up the Globe to G) there will appear a red Colour in that side of the Globe towards the Sun, and if the Angle be made greater (suppose by lifting up the Globe to H) the red will turn successively to the other Colours, yellow, green and blue. The same thing I have tried by letting a Globe rest, and raising or depressing the Eye, or otherwise moving it to make the Angle of a just magnitude.
I have heard it represented, that if the Light of a Candle be refracted by a Prism to the Eye; when the blue Colour falls upon the Eye the Spectator shall see red in the Prism, and when the red falls upon the Eye he shall see blue; and if this were certain, the Colours of the Globe and Rain-bow ought to appear in a contrary order to what we find. But the Colours of the Candle being very faint, the mistake seems to arise from the difficulty of discerning what Colours fall on the Eye. For, on the contrary, I have sometimes had occasion to observe in the Sun's Light refracted by a Prism, that the Spectator always sees that Colour in the Prism which falls upon his Eye. And the same I have found true also in Candle-light. For when the Prism is moved slowly from the line which is drawn directly from the Candle to the Eye, the red appears first in the Prism and then the blue, and therefore each of them is seen when it falls upon the Eye. For the red passes over the Eye first, and then the blue.
<134>
The Light which comes through Drops of Rain by two refractions without any reflexion, ought to appear strongest at the distance of about 26 degrees from the Sun, and to decay gradually both ways as the distance from him increases and decreases. And the same is to be understood of Light transmitted through spherical Hail-stones. And if the Hail be a little flatted, as it often is, the Light transmitted may grow so strong at a little less distance than that of 26 degrees, as to form a Halo about the Sun or Moon; which Halo, as often as the Hail-stones are duly figured may be coloured, and then it must be red within by the least refrangible rays, and blue without by the most refrangible ones, especially if the Hail-stones have opake Globules of Snow in their center to intercept the Light within the Halo (as Hugenius has observed) and make the inside thereof more distinctly defined than it would otherwise be. For such Hail-stones, though spherical, by terminating the Light by the Snow, may make a Halo red within and colourless without, and darker in the red than without, as Halos use to be. For of those rays which pass close by the Snow the rubriform will be least refracted, and so come to the Eye in the directest lines.
The Light which passes through a Drop of rain after two refractions, and three or more reflexions, is scarce strong enough to cause a sensible Bow; but in those Cylinders of Ice by which Hugenius explains the Parhelia, it may perhaps be sensible.
<135>
PROP. X. PROB. V.
By the discovered Properties of Light to explain the permanent Colours of Natural Bodies.
These Colours arise from hence, that some natural Bodies reflect some sorts of rays, others other sorts more copiously than the rest. Minium reflects the least refrangible or red-making rays most copiously, and thence appears red. Violets reflect the most refrangible, most copiously, and thence have their Colour, and so of other Bodies. Every Body reflects the rays of its own Colour more copiously than the rest, and from their excess and predominance in the reflected Light has its Colour.
EXPER. XVII.
For if in the homogeneal Lights obtained by the solution of the Problem proposed in the 4th Proposition of the first Book you place Bodies of several Colours, you will find, as I have done, that every Body looks most splendid and luminous in the Light of its own Colour. Cinnaber in the homogeneal red Light is most resplendent, in the green Light it is manifestly less resplendent, and in the blue Light still less. indico in the violet blue Light is most resplendent, and its splendor is gradually diminished as it is removed thence by degrees through the green and yellow Light to the red. By a Leek the green Light, and next that the blue and yellow which compound green, are more strongly re <136> flected than the other Colours red and violet, and so of the rest. But to make these Experiments the more manifest, such Bodies ought to be chosen as have the fullest and most vivid Colours, and two of those Bodies are to be compared together. Thus, for instance, if Cinnaber and ultra marine blue, or some other full blue be held together in the homogeneal Light, they will both appear red, but the Cinnaber will appear of a strongly luminous and resplendent red, and the ultra marine blue of a faint obscure and dark red; and if they be held together in the blue homogeneal Light, tlley will both appear blue, but the ultra marine will appear of a strongly luminous and resplendent blue, and {the} Cinnaber of a faint and dark blue. Which puts it {out} of dispute, that the Cinnaber reflects the {red Light} much more copiously than the ultra marine doth, and the ultra marine reflects the blue Light much more copiously than the Cinnaber doth. The same Experiment may be tryed successfully with red Lead and Indico, or with any other two coloured Bodies, if due allowance be made for the different strength or weakness of their Colour and Light.
And as the reason of the Colours of natural Bodies is evident by these Experiments, so it is further confirmed and put past dispute by the two first Experiments of the first Book, whereby 'twas proved in such Bodies that the reflected Lights which differ in Colours do differ also in degrees of refrangibility. For thence it's certain, that some Bodies reflect the more refrangible, others the less refrangible rays more copiously.
<137>
And that this is not only a true reason of these Colours, but even the only reason may appear further from this consideration, that the Colour of homogeneal Light cannot be changed by the reflexion of natural Bodies.
For if Bodies by reflexion cannot in the least change the Colour of any one sort of rays, they cannot appear coloured by any other means than by reflecting those which either are of their own Colour, or which by mixture must produce it.
But in trying Experiments of this kind care must be had that the Light be sufficiently homogeneal. For if Bodies be illuminated by the ordinary prismatick Colours, they will appear neither of their own day-light Colours, nor of the Colour of the Light cast on them, but of some middle Colour between both, as I have found by Experience. Thus red Lead (for instance) illuminated with the ordinary prismatick green will not appear either red or green, but orange or yellow, or between yellow and green accordingly, as the green Light by which 'tis illuminated is more or less compounded. For because red Lead appears red when illuminated with white Light, wherein all sorts of rays are equally mixed, and in the green Light all sorts of rays are not equally mixed, the excess of the yellow-making, green-making and blue-making rays in the incident green Light, will cause those rays to abound so much in the reflected Light as to draw the Colour from red towards their Colour. And because the red Lead reflects the red-making rays most copiously in proportion to their number, and next after them the orange-making and yellow-making rays; these rays in <138> the reflected Light will be more in proportion to the Light than they were in the incident green Light, and thereby will draw the reflected Light from green towards their Colour. And therefore the red Lead will appear neither red nor green, but of a Colour between both.
In transparently coloured Liquors 'tis observable, that their Colour uses to vary with their thickness. Thus, for instance, a red Liquor in a conical Glass held between the Light and the Eye, looks of a pale and dilute yellow at the bottom where 'tis thin, and a little higher where 'tis thicker grows orange, and where 'tis still thicker becomes red, and where 'tis thickest the red is deepest and darkest. For it is to be conceived that such a Liquor stops the indico-making and violet-making rays most easily, the blue-making rays more difficultly, the green-making rays still more difficultly, and the red-making most difficultly: And that if the thickness of the Liquor be only so much as suffices to stop a competent number of the violet-making and indico-making rays, without diminishing much the number of the rest, the rest must (by Prop. 6. Lib. 2.) compound a pale yellow. But if the Liquor be so much thicker as to stop also a great number of the blue-making rays, and some of the green-making, the rest must compound an orange; and where it is so thick as to stop also a great number of the green-making and a considerable number of the yellow-making, the rest must begin to compound a red, and this red must grow deeper and darker as the yellow-making and orange-making rays are more and more stopt by increasing the thickness of the Liquor, so that few rays besides the red-making can get through.
<139>
Of this kind is an Experiment lately related to me by Mr. Halley, who, in diving deep into the Sea, found in a clear Sun-shine day, that when he was sunk many Fathoms deep into the Water, the upper part of his Hand on which the Sun shone directly through the Water looked of a red Colour, and the under part of his Hand illuminated by Light reflected from the Water below looked green. For thence it may be gathered, that the Sea-water reflects back the violet and blue-making rays most easily, and lets the red-making rays pass most freely and copiously to great depths. For thereby the Sun's direct Light at all great depths, by reason of the predominating red-making rays, must appear red; and the greater the depth is, the fuller and intenser must that red be. And at such depths as the violet-making rays scarce penetrate unto, the blue-making, green-making and yellow-making rays being reflected from below more copiously than the red-making ones, must compound a green.
Now if there be two Liquors of full Colours, suppose a red and blue, and both of them so thick as suffices to make their Colours sufficiently full; though either Liquor be sufficiently transparent apart, yet will you not be able to see through both together. For if only the red-making rays pass through one Liquor, and only the blue-making through the other, no rays can pass through both. This Mr. Hook tried casually with Glass-wedges filled with red and blue Liquors, and was surprized at the unexpected event, the reason of it being then unknown; which makes me trust the more to his Experiment, though I have not tryed it my self. But he that would repeat it, must take care the Liquors be of very good and full Colours.
<140>
Now whilst Bodies become coloured by reflecting or transmitting this or that sort of rays more copiously than the rest, it is to be conceived that they stop and stifle in themselves the rays which they do not reflect or transmit. For if Gold be foliated and held between your Eye and the Light, the Light looks blue, and therefore massy Gold lets into its Body the blue-making rays to be reflected to and fro within it till they be stopt and stifled, whilst it reflects the yellow-making outwards, and thereby looks yellow. And much after the same manner that Leaf-gold is yellow by reflected, and blue by transmitted Light, and massy Gold is yellow in all positions of the Eye; there are some Liquors as the tincture of Lignum Nephriticum, and some sorts of Glass which transmit one sort of Light most copiously, and reflect another sort, and thereby look of several Colours, according to the position of the Eye to the Light. But if these Liquors or Glasses were so thick and massy that no Light could get through them, I question not but they would like all other opake Bodies appear of one and the same Colour in all positions of the Eye, though this I cannot yet affirm by experience. For all coloured Bodies, so far as my Observation reaches, may be seen through if made sufficiently thin, and therefore are in some measure transparent, and differ only in degrees of transparency from tinged transparent Liquors; these Liquors, as well as those Bodies, by a sufficient thickness becoming opake. A transparent Body which looks of any Colour by transmitted Light, may also look of the same Colour by reflected Light, the Light of that Colour being reflected by the further surface of the Body, or by the Air beyond it. And then the reflected Colour will be diminished, and perhaps cease, by <141> making the Body very thick, and pitching it on the back-side to diminish the reflexion of its further surface, so that the Light reflected from the tinging particles may predominate. In such cases, the Colour of the reflected Light will be apt to vary from that of the Light transmitted. But whence it is that tinged Bodies and Liquors reflect some sort of rays, and intromit or transmit other sorts, shall be said in the next Book. In this Proposition I content my self to have put it past dispute, that Bodies have such Properties, and thence appear coloured.
PROP. XI. PROB. VI.
By mixing coloured Lights to compound a Beam of Light of the same Colour and Nature with a Beam of the Sun's direct Light, and therein to experience the truth of the foregoing Propositions.
Let ABCabc[Image 17] represent a Prism by which the Sun's Light let into a dark Chamber through the Hole F, may be refracted towards the Lens MN, and paint upon it at p, q, r, s and t, the usual Colours violet, blue, green, yellow, and red, and let the diverging rays by the refraction of this Lens converge again towards X, and there, by the mixture of all those their Colours, compound a white according to what was shewn above. Then let another Prism DEGdeg, parallel to the former, be placed at X, to refract that white Light upwards towards Y. Let the refracting Angles of the Prisms, and their distances from the Lens be equal, so that the rays which converged from the Lens towards X, and without refraction, would there have crossed and diverged again, may by the refraction of the second Prism be <142> reduced into Parallelism and diverge no more. For then those rays will recompose a Beam of white Light XY. If the refracting Angle of either Prism be the bigger, that Prism must be so much the nearer to the Lens. You will know when the Prisms and the Lens are well set together by observing if the Beam of Light XY which comes out of the second Prism be perfectly white to the very edges of the Light, and at all distances from the Prism continue perfectly and totally white like a Beam of the Sun's Light. For till this happens, the position of the Prisms and Lens to one another must be corrected, and then if by the help of a long Beam of Wood, as is represented in the Figure, or by a Tube, or some other such instrument made for that purpose, they be made fast in that situation, you may try all the same Experiments in this compounded Beam of Light XY, which in the foregoing Experiments have been made in the Sun's direct Light. For this compounded Beam of Light has the same appearance, and is endowed with all the same Properties with a direct Beam of the Sun's Light, so far as my Observation reaches. And in trying Experiments in this Beam you may by stopping any of the Colours p, q, r, s and t, at the Lens, see how the Colours produced in the Experiments are no other than those which the rays had at the Lens before they entered the composition of this Beam: And by consequence that they arise not from any new modifications of the Light by refractions and reflexions, but from the various separations and mixtures of the rays originally endowed with their colour-making qualities.
So, for instance, having with a Lens  Inches broad, and two Prisms on either hand  Feet distant from the Lens, made such {a} Beam of compounded Light: to <143> examin the reason of the Colours made by Prisms, I refracted this compounded Beam of Light XY with another Prism HIKkh, and thereby cast the usual prismatick Colours PQRST upon the Paper LV placed behind. And then by stopping any of the Colours p, q, r, s, t, at the Lens, I found that the same Colour would vanish at the Paper. So if the Purple P was stopped at the Lens, the Purple P upon the Paper would vanish, and the rest of the Colours would remain unaltered, unless perhaps the blue, so far as some purple latent in it at the Lens might be separated from it by the following refractions. And so by intercepting the green upon the Lens, the green R upon the Paper would vanish, and so of the rest; which plainly shews, that as the white Beam of Light XY was compounded of seve Lights variously coloured at the Lens, so the Colours which afterwards emerge out of it by new refractions are no other than those of which its whiteness was compounded. The refraction of the Prism HIKkh generates the Colours PQRST upon the Paper, not by changing the colorific qualities of the rays, but by separating the rays which had the very same colorific qualities before they entered the composition of the refracted Beam of white Light XY. For otherwise the rays which were of one Colour at the Lens might be of another upon the Paper, contrary to what we find.
So again, to examin the reason of the Colours of natural Bodies, I placed such Bodies in the Beam of Light XY, and found that they all appeared there of those their own Colours which they have in Day-light, and that those Colours depend upon the rays which had the same Colours at the Lens before they entred the compo <144> sition of that Beam. Thus, for instance, Cinnaber illuminated by this Beam appears of the same red Colour as in Day-light ; and if at the Lens you intercept the green-making and blue-making rays, its redness will become more full and lively: But if you there intercept the red-making rays, it will not any longer appear red, but become yellow or green, or of some other Colour, according to the sorts of rays which you do not intercept. So Gold in this Light XY appears of the same yellow Colour as in Day-light, but by intercepting at the Lens a due quantity of the yellow-making rays it will appear white like Silver (as I have tryed) which shews that its yellowness arises from the excess of the intercepted rays tinging that whiteness with their Colour when they are let pass. So the Infusion of Lignum Nephriticum (as I have also tryed) when held in this Beam of Light XY, looks blue by the reflected part of the Light, and blue by the transmitted part of it, as when 'tis view'd in Day-light, but if you intercept the blue at the Lens the infusion will lose its reflected blue Colour, whilst its transmitted red remains perfect and by the loss of some blue-making rays wherewith it was allayed becomes more intense and full. And, on the contrary, if the red and orange-making rays be intercepted at the Lens, the infusion will lose its transmitted red, whilst its blue will remain and become more full and perfect. Which shews, that the infusion does not tinge the rays with blue and yellow, but only transmit those most copiously which were red-making before, and reflects those most copiously which were blue-making before. And after the same manner may the reasons of other Phænomena be examined, by trying them in this artificial Beam of Light XY.

Observations concerning the Reflexions, Refractions, and Colours of thin transparent Bodies.
IT has been observed by others that transparent Substances, as Glass, Water, Air, &c. when made very thin by being blown into Bubbles, or otherwise formed into Plates, do exhibit various Colours according to their various thinness, although at a greater thickness they appear very clear and colourless. In the former Book I forbore to treat of these Colours, because they seemed of a more difficult consideration, and were not necessary for establishing the Properties of Light there discoursed of. But because they may conduce to further discoveries for completing the Theory of Light, especially as to the constitution of the parts of natural Bodies, on which their Colours or Transparency depend; I have here set down an account of them. To render this Discourse short and distinct, I have first described the principal of my <2> Observations, and then considered and made use of them. The Observations are these.
OBS. I.
Compressing two Prisms hard together that their Sides (which by chance were a very little convex)might somewhere touch one another: I found the place in which they touched to become absolutely transparent, as if they had there been one continued piece of Glass. For when the Light fell so obliquely on the Air, which in other places was between them,as to be all reflected; it seemed in that place of contact to be wholly transmitted, insomuch that when looked upon, it appeared like a black or dark Spot, by reason that little or no sensible Light was reflected from thence, as from other places; and when looked through it seemed (as it were) a hole in that Air which was formed into a thin Plate, by being compressed between the Glasses. And through this hole Objects that were beyond might be seen distinctly, which could not at all be seen through other parts of the Glasses where the Air was interjacent. Although the Glasses were a little convex, yet this transparent Spot was of a considerable breadth, which breadth seemed principally to proceed from the yielding inwards of the parts of the Glasses, by reason of their mutual pressure. For by pressing them very hard together it would become much broader than otherwise.
<3>
OBS. II.
When the Plate of Air, by turning the Prisms about their common Axis, became so little inclined to the incident Rays, that some of them began to be transmitted, there arose in it many slender Arcs of Colours which at first were shaped almost like the Conchoid, as you see them delineated in the first Figure.[Image 1] And by continuing the motion of the Prisms, these Arcs increased and bended more and more about the said transparent Spot, till they were completed into Circles or Rings incompassing it, and afterwards continually grew more and more contracted.
These Arcs at their first appearance were of a violet and blue Colour, and between them were white Arcs of Circles, which presently by continuing the motion of the Prisms became a little tinged in their inward Limbs with red and yellow, and to their outward Limbs the blue was adjacent. So that the order of these Colours from the central dark Spot, was at that time white, blue, violet; black; red, orange, yellow, white, blue, violet, &c. But the yellow and red were much fainter than the blue and violet.
The motion of the Prisms about their Axis being continued, these Colours contracted more and more, shrinking towards the whiteness on either side of it, until they totally vanished into it. And then the Circles in those parts appeared black and white, without any other Colours intermixed. But by further moving the Prisms about, the Colours again emerged out of the whiteness, the violet and blue at its inward Limb, and at its out <4> ward Limb the red and yellow. So that now their order from the central Spot was white, yellow, red; black; violet, blue, white, yellow, red, &c. contrary to what it was before.
OBS. III.
When the Rings or some parts of them appeared only black and white, they were very distinct and well defined, and the blackness seemed as intense as that of the central Spot. Also in the borders of the Rings, where the Colours began to emerge out of the whiteness, they were pretty distinct, which made them visible to a very great Multitude. I have sometimes numbered above thirty Successions (reckoning every black and white Ring for one Succession) and seen more of them, which by reason of their smalness I could not number. But in other Positions of the Prisms, at which the Rings appeared of many Colours, I could not distinguish above eight or nine of them, and the exterior of those were very confused and dilute.
In these two Observations to see the Rings distinct, and without any other Colour than black and white, I found it necessary to hold my Eye at a good distance from them. For by approaching nearer, although in the same inclination of my Eye to the plane of the Rings, there emerged a blueish Colour out of the white, which by dilating it self more and more into the black rendered the Circles less distinct, and left the white a little tinged with red and yellow. I found also by looking through a slit or oblong hole, which was narrower than the Pupil of my Eye, and held close to <5> it parallel to the Prisms, I could see the Circles much distincter and visible to a far greater number than otherwise.
OBS. IV.
To observe more nicely the order of the Colours which arose out of the white Circles as the Rays became less and less inclined to the plate of Air; I took two Object Glasses, the one a Plano-convex for a fourteen-foot Telescope, and the other a large double convex for one of about fifty-foot; and upon this, laying the other with its plane-side downwards, I pressed them slowly together,to make the Colours successively emerge in the middle of the Circles, and then slowly lifted the upper Glass from the lower to make them successively vanish again in the same place. The Colour, which by pressing the Glasses together emerged last in the middle of the other Colours, would upon its first appearance look like a Circle of a Colour almost uniform from the circumference to the center, and by compressing the Glasses still more, grow continually broader until a new Colour emerged in its center, and thereby it became a Ring encompassing that new Colour. And by compressing the Glasses still more, the Diameter of this Ring would increase, and the breadth of its Orbit or Perimeter decrease until another new Colour emerged in the center of the last: And so on until a third, a fourth, a fifth, and other following new Colours successively emerged there, and became Rings encompassing the innermost Colour, the last of which was the black Spot. And, on the contrary, by <6> lifting up the upper Glass from the lower, the diameter of the Rings would decrease, and the breadth of their Orbit increase, until their Colours reached successively to the center; and then they being of a considerable breadth, I could more easily discern and distinguish their Species than before. And by this means I observed their Succession and Quantity to be as followeth.
Next, to the pellucid central Spot made by the contact of the Glasses succeeded blue, white, yellow, and red, the blue was so little in quantity that I could not discern it in the circles made by the Prisms, nor could I well distinguish any violet in it, but the yellow and red were pretty copious, and seemed about as much in extent as the white, and four or five times more than the blue. The next Circuit in order of Colours immediately encompassing these were violet, blue, green, yellow, and red, and these were all of them copious and vivid, excepting the green, which was very little in quantity, and seemed much more faint and dilute than the other Colours. Of the other four, the violet was the least in extent, and the blue less than the yellow or red. The third Circuit or Order was purple, blue, green, yellow, and red; in which the purple seemed more reddish than the violet in the former Circuit, and the green was much more conspicuous, being as brisque and copious as any of the other Colours, except the yellow; but the red began to be a little faded, inclining very much to purple. After this succeeded the fourth Circuit of green and red. The green was very copious and lively, inclining on the one side to blue, and on the other side to yellow. But in <7> this fourth Circuit there was neither violet, blue, nor yellow, and the red was very imperfect and dirty. Also the succeeding Colours became more and more imperfect and dilute, till after three or four Revolutions they ended in perfect whiteness. Their Form, when the Glasses were most compressed so as to make the black Spot appear in the Center, is delineated in the Second Figure[Image 2]; where a, b, c, d, e: f, g, h, i, k: l, m, n, o, p: q, r: s, t: v, x: y denote the Colours reck'ned in order from the center, black, blue, white, yellow, red: violet, blue, green, yellow, red: purple, blue, green, yellow, red: green, red: greenish blue, red: greenish blue, pale red: greenish blue, reddish white.
OBS. V.
To determine the interval of the Glasses, or thickness of the interjacent Air, by which each Colour was produced, I measured the Diameters of the first six Rings at the most lucid part of their Orbits, and squaring them, I found their Squares to be in the Arithmetical Progression of the odd Numbers, 1. 3. 5. 7. 9. 11. And since one of these Glasses was Plain, and the other Spherical, their Intervals at those Rings must be in the same Progression. I measured also the Diameters of the dark or faint Rings between the more lucid Colours, and found their Squares to be in the Arithmetical Progression of the even Numbers, 2. 4. 6. 8. 10. 12. And it being very nice and difficult to take these measures exactly; I repeated them at divers times at divers parts of the Glasses, that by their Agreement I might be confirmed in them. And the same method I used in <8> determining some others of the following Observations.
OBS. VI.
The Diameter of the sixth Ring at the most lucid part of its Orbit was  parts of an Inch, and the Diameter of the Sphere on which the double convex Object-Glass was ground was about 102 Feet, and hence I gathered the thickness of the Air or Aereal Interval of the Glasses at that Ring. But some time after, suspecting that in making this Observation I had not determined the Diameter of the Sphere with sufficient accurateness, and being uncertain whether the Plano-convex Glass was truly plain, and not something concave or convex on that side which I accounted plain; and whether I had not pressed the Glasses together, as I often did, to make them touch. (For by pressing such Glasses together their parts easily yield inwards, and the Rings thereby become sensibly broader than they would be, did the Glasses keep their Figures.) I repeated the Experiment, and found the Diameter of the sixth lucid Ring about  parts of an Inch. I repeated the Experiment also with such an Object-Glass of another Telescope as I had at hand. This was a double convex ground on both sides to one and the same Sphere, and its Focus was distant from it  Inches. And thence, if the Sines of incidence and refraction of the bright yellow Light be assumed in proportion as 11 to 17, the Diameter of the Sphere to which the Glass was figured will by computation be found 182 Inches. This Glass I laid upon a flat one, so that the <9> black Spot appeared in the middle of the Rings of Colours without any other pressure than that of the weight of the Glass. And now measuring the Diameter of the fifth dark Circle as accurately as I could, I found it the fifth part of an Inch precisely. This measure was taken with the points of a pair of Compasses on the upper surface on the upper Glass, and my Eye was about eight or nine Inches distance from the Glass, almost perpendicularly over it, and the Glass was  of an Inch thick, and thence it is easy to collect that the true Diameter of the Ring between the Glasses was greater than its measured Diameter above the Glasses in the proportion Of 80 to 79 or thereabouts, and by consequence equal to  parts of an Inch, and its true Semi-diameter equal to  parts. Now as the Diameter of the Sphere (182 Inches) is to the Semi-diameter of this fifth dark Ring ( parts of an Inch) so is this Semi-diameter to the thickness of the Air at this fifth dark Ring; which is therefore  or  parts of an Inch, and the fifth part thereof; viz. the th part of an Inch, is the thickness of the Air at the first of these dark Rings.
The same Experiment I repeated with another double convex Object-glass ground on both sides to one and the same Sphere. Its Focus was distant from it  Inches, and therefore the Diameter of that Sphere was 184 Inches. This Glass being laid upon the same plain Glass, the Diameter of the fifth of the dark Rings, when the black Spot in their center appeared plainly without pressing the Glasses, was by the measure of the Compasses upon the upper Glass  parts of an Inch, and by consequence between the Glasses it was . For the upper Glass was  of an Inch thick, <10> and my Eye was distant from it 8 Inches. And a third proportional to half this from the Diameter of the Sphere is  parts of an Inch. This is therefore the thickness of the Air at this Ring, and a fifth part thereof, viz. the th part of an Inch is the thickness thereof at the first of the Rings, as above.
I tryed the same thing by laying these Object-Glasses upon flat pieces of a broken Looking-glass, and found the same measures of the Rings: Which makes me rely upon them till they can be determined more accurately by Glasses ground to larger Spheres, though in such Glasses greater care must be taken of a true plain.
These Dimensions were taken when my Eye was placed almost perpendicularly over the Glasses, being about an Inch, or an Inch and a quarter, distant from the incident rays, and eight Inches distant from the Glass; so that the rays were inclined to the Glass in an Angle of about 4 degrees. Whence by the following Observation you will understand, that had the rays been perpendicular to the Glasses, the thickness of the Air at these Rings would have been less in the proportion of the Radius to the Secant of 4 degrees, that is of 10000. Let the thicknesses found be therefore diminished in this proportion, and they will become  and , or (to use the nearest round number) the th part of an Inch. This is the thickness of the Air at the darkest part of the first dark Ring made by perpendicular rays, and half this thickness multiplied by the progression, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. gives the thicknesses of the Air at the most luminous parts of all the brightest Rings, viz. , , , , &c. their arithmetical <11> means , , , &c. being its thicknesses at the darkest parts of all the dark ones.
OBS. VII.
The Rings were least when my Eye was placed perpendicularly over the Glasses in the Axis of the Rings: And when I viewed them obliquely they became bigger, continually swelling as I removed my Eye further from the Axis. And partly by measuring the Diameter of the same Circle at several obliquities of my Eye, partly by other means, as also by making use of the two Prisms for very great obliquities, I found its Diameter, and consequently the thickness of the Air at its perimeter in all those obliquities to be very nearly in the proportions expressed in this Table.

<12>
In the two first Columns are expressed the obliquities of the incident and emergent rays to the plate of the Air, that is, their angles of incidence and refraction. In the third Column the Diameter of any coloured Ring at those obliquities is expressed in parts, of which ten constitute that Diameter when the rays are perpendicular. And in the fourth Column the thickness of the Air at the circumference of that Ring is expressed in parts of which also ten constitute its thickness when the rays are perpendicular.
And from these measures I seem to gather this Rule: That the thickness of the Air is proportional to the secant of an angle, whose Sine is a certain mean proportional between the Sines of incidence and refraction. And that mean proportional, so far as by these measures I can determine it, is the first of an hundred and six arithmetical mean proportionals between those Sines counted from the Sine of refraction when the refraction is made out of the Glass into the plate of Air, or from the Sine of incidence when the refraction is made out of the plate of Air into the Glass.
OBS. VIII.
The dark Spot in the middle of the Rings increased also by the obliquation of the Eye, although almost insensibly. But if instead of the Object-Glasses the Prisms were made use of, its increase was more manifest when viewed so obliquely that no Colours appeared about it. It was least when the rays were incident most obliquely on the interjacent Air, and as the obliquity decreased it increased more and more until the coloured Rings ap <13> peared, and then decreased again, but not so much as it increased before. And hence it is evident, that the transparency was not only at the absolute contact of the Glasses, but also where they had some little interval. I have sometimes observed the Diameter of that Spot to be between half and two fifth parts of the Diameter of the exterior circumference of the red in the first circuit or revolution of Colours when viewed almost perpendicularly; whereas when viewed obliquely it hath wholly vanished and become opake and white like the other parts of the Glass; whence it may be collected that the Glasses did then scarcely, or not at all, touch one another, and that their interval at the perimeter of that Spot when viewed perpendicularly was about a fifth or sixth part of their interval at the circumference of the said red.
OBS. IX.
By looking through the two contiguous Object-Glasses, I found that the interjacent Air exhibited Rings of Colours, as well by transmitting Light as by reflecting it. The central Spot was now white, and from it the order of the Colours were yellowish red; black; violet, blue, white, yellow, red; violet, blue, green, yellow, red, &c. But these Colours were very faint and dilute unless when the Light was trajected very obliquely through the Glasses: For by that means they became pretty vivid. Only the first yellowish red, like the blue in the fourth Observation, was so little and faint as scarcely to be discerned. Comparing the coloured Rings made by reflexion, with these made by <14> transmission of the Light; I found that white was opposite to black, red to blue, yellow to violet, and green to a compound of red and violet. That is, those parts of the Glass were black when looked through, which when looked upon appeared white, and on the contrary. And so those which in one case exhibited blue, did in the other case exhibit red. And the like of the other Colours. The manner you have represented in the third Figure[Image 3], where AB, CD, are the surfaces of the Glasses contiguous at E, and the black lines between them are their distances in arithmetical progression, and the Colours written above are seen by reflected Light, and those below by Light transmitted.
OBS. X.
Wetting the Object-Glasses a little at their edges, the water crept in slowly between them, and the Circles thereby became less and the Colours more faint: Insomuch that as the water crept along one half of them at which it first arrived would appear broken off from the other half, and contracted into a less room. By measuring them I found the proportions of their Diameters to the Diameters of the like Circles made by Air to be about seven to eight, and consequently the intervals of the Glasses at like Circles, caused by those two mediums Water and Air,are as about three to four. Perhaps it may be a general Rule, That if any other medium more or less dense than water be compressed between the Glasses, their intervals at the Rings caused thereby will be to their intervals caused by interjacent <15> Air, as the Sines are which measure the refraction made out of that medium into Air.
OBS. XI
When the water was between the Glasses, if I pressed the upper Glass variously at its edges to make the Rings move nimbly from one place to another, a little white Spot would immediately follow the center of them, which upon creeping in of the ambient water into that place would presently vanish. Its appearance was such as interjacent Air would have caused, and it exhibited the same Colours. But it was not Air, for where any bubbles of Air were in the water they would not vanish. The reflexion must have rather been caused by a subtiler medium, which could recede through the Glasses at the creeping in of the water.
OBS. XII.
These Observations were made in the open Air. But further to examine the effects of coloured Light falling on the Glasses, I darkened the Room, and viewed them by reflexion of the Colours of a Prism cast on a Sheet of white Paper, my Eye being so placed that I could see the coloured Paper by reflexion in the Glasses, as in a Looking-glass. And by this means the Rings became distincter and visible to a far greater number than in the open Air. I have sometimes seen more than twenty of them, whereas in the open Air I could not discern above eight or nine.
<16>
OBS. XIII.
Appointing an assistant to move the Prism to and fro about its Axis, that all the Colours might successively fall on that part of the Paper which I saw by reflexion from that part of the Glasses, where the Circles appeared, so that all the Colours might be successively reflected from the Circles to my Eye whilst I held it immovable, I found the Circles which the red Light made to be manifestly bigger than those which were made by the blue and violet. And it was very pleasant to see them gradually swell or contract accordingly as the Colour of the Light was changed. The interval of the Glasses at any of the Rings when they were made by the utmost red Light, was to their interval at the same Ring when made by the utmost violet, greater than as 3 to 2, and less than as 13 to 8,by the most of my Observations it was as 14 to 9. And this proportion seemed very nearly the same in all obliquities of my Eye; unless when two Prisms were made use of instead of the Object-Glasses. For then at a certain great obliquity of my Eye, the Rings made by the several Colours seemed equal, and at a greater obliquity those made by the violet would be greater than the same Rings made by the red. The refraction of the Prism in this case causing the most refrangible rays to fall more obliquely on that plate of the Air than the least refrangible ones. Thus the Experiment succeeded in the coloured Light, which was sufficlently strong and copious to make the Rings sensible. And thence it may be gathered, that if the most refrangible and least <17> refrangible rays had been copious enough to make the Rings sensible without the mixture of other rays, the proportion which here was 14 to 9 would have been a little greater, suppose  or {} to 9.
OBS. XIV.
Whilst the Prism was turn'd about its Axis with an uniform motion, to make all the several Colours fall successively upon the Object-Glasses, and thereby to make the Rings contract and dilate: The contraction or dilatation of each Ring thus made by the variation of its Colour was swiftest in the red, and slowest in the violet, and in the intermediate Colours it had intermediate degrees of celerity. Comparing the quantity of contraction and dilatation made by all the degrees of each Colour, I found that it was greatest in the red; less in the yellow, still less in the blue, and least in the violet. And to make as just an estimation as I could of the proportions of their contractions or dilatations, I observed that the whole contraction or dilatation of the Diameter of any Ring made by all the degrees of red, was to that of the Diameter of the same Ring made by all the degrees of violet, as about four to three, or five to four, and that when the Light was of the middle Colour between yellow and green, the Diameter of the Ring was very nearly an arithmetical mean between the greatest Diameter of the same Ring made by the outmost red, and the least Diameter thereof made by the outmost violet: Contrary to what happens in the Colours of the oblong Spectrum made by the refraction of a Prism, where the red is most contracted, the violet most expanded, and <18> in the midst of all the Colours is the confine of green and blue. And hence I seem to collect that the thicknesses of the Air between the Glasses there, where the Ring is successively made by the limits of the five principal Colours (red, yellow, green, blue, violet) in order (that is, by the extreme red, by the limit of red and yellow in the middle of the orange, by the limit of yellow and green, by the limit of green and blue, by the limit of blue and violet in the middle of the indigo, and by the extreme violet) are to one another very nearly as the six lengths of a Chord which found the notes in a sixth Major, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, la. But it agrees something better with the Observation to say, that the thicknesses of the Air between the Glasses there, where the Rings are successively made by the limits of the seven Colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet in order, are to one another as the Cube Roots of the Squares of the eight lengths of a Chord, which found the notes in an eighth, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol; that is, as the Cube Roots of the Squares of the Numbers, 1, , , , , , {}, .
OBS. XV.
These Rings were not of various Colours like those made in the open Air, but appeared all over of that prismatique Colour only with which they were illuminated. And by projecting the prismatique Colours immediately upon the Glasses, I found that the Light which fell on the dark Spaces which were between the Coloured Rings, was transmitted through the Glasses without any variation of Colour. For on a <19> white Paper placed behind, it would paint Rings of the same Colour with those which were reflected, and of the bigness of their immediate Spaces. And from thence the origin of these Rings is manifest; namely, That the Air between the Glasses, according to its various thickness, is disposed in some places to reflect, and in others to transmit the Light of any one Colour (as you may see represented in the fourth Figure[Image 4]) and in the same place to reflect that of one Colour where it transmits that of another.
OBS. XVI.
The Squares of the Diameters of these Rings made by any prismatique Colour were in arithmetical progression as in the fifth Observation. And the Diameter of the sixth Circle, when made by the citrine yellow, and viewed almost perpendicularly, was about  parts of an Inch, or a little less, agreeable to the sixth Observation.
The precedent Observations were made with a rarer thin medium, terminated by a denser, such as was Air or Water compressed between two Glasses. In those that follow are set down the appearances of a denser medium thin'd within a rarer, such as are plates of Muscovy-glass, Bubbles of Water, and some other thin substances terminated on all sides with Air.
<20>
OBS. XVII.
If a Bubble be blown with Water first made tenacious by dissolving a little Soap in it, 'tis a common Observation, that after a while it will appear tinged with a great variety of Colours. To defend these Bubbles from being agitated by the external Air (whereby their Colours are irregularly moved one among another, so that no accurate Observation can be made of them,) as soon as I had blown any of them I covered it with a clear Glass, and by that means its Colours emerged in a very regular order, like so many concentrick Rings incompassing the top of the Bubble. And as the Bubble grew thinner by the continual subsiding of the Water, these Rings dilated slowly and over-spread the whole Bubble, descending in order to the bottom of it, where they vanished successively. In the mean while, after all the Colours were emerged at the top, there grew in the Center of the Rings a small round black Spot, like that in the first Observation, which continually dilated it self till it became sometimes more than  or  of an Inch in breadth before the Bubble broke. At first I thought there had been no Light reflected from the Water in that place, but observing it more curiously, I saw within it several smaller round Spots, which appeared much blacker and darker than the rest, whereby I knew that there was some reflexion at the other places which were not so dark as those Spots. And by further Tryal I found that I could see the Images of some things (as of a Candle or the Sun) very faintly reflected, not only from the great black Spot, but <21> also from the little darker Spots which were within it.
Besides the aforesaid coloured Rings there would often appear small Spots of Colours, ascending and descending up and down the sides of the Bubble, by reason of some inequalities in the subsiding of the Water. And sometimes small black Spots generated at the sides would ascend up to the larger black Spot at the top of the Bubble, and unite with it.
OBS. XVIII.
Because the Colours of these Bubbles were more extended and lively than those of the Air thin'd between two Glasses, and so more easy to be distinguished, I shall here give you a further description of their order, as they were observed in viewing them by reflexion of the Skies when of a white Colour, whilst a black Substance was placed behind the Bubble. And they were these, red, blue; red, blue; red, blue; red, green; red, yellow, green, blue, purple; red, yellow, green, blue, violet; red, yellow, white, blue, black.
The three first Successions of red and blue were very dilute and dirty, especially the first, where the red seemed in a manner to be white. Among these there was scarce any other Colour sensible besides red and blue, only the blues (and principally the second blue) inclined a little to green.
The fourth red was also dilute and dirty, but not so much as the former three; after that succeeded little or no yellow, but a copious green, which at first inclined a little to yellow, and then became a pretty brisque <22> and good willow green, and afterwards changed to a bluish Colour; but there succeeded neither blue nor violet.
The fifth red at first inclined very much to purple, and afterwards became more bright and brisque, but yet not very pure. This was succeeded with a very bright and intense yellow, which was but little in quantity, and soon changed to green: But that green was copious and something more pure, deep and lively, than the former green. After that followed an excellent blue of a bright sky-colour, and then a purple, which was less in quantity than the blue, and much inclined to red.
The sixth red was at first of a very fair and lively Scarlet, and soon after of a brighter Colour, being very pure and brisque, and the best of all the reds. Then after a lively orange followed an intense bright and copious yellow, which was also the best of all the yellows, and this changed first to a greenish yellow, and then to a greenish blue; but the green between the yellow and the blue, was very little and dilute, seeming rather a greenish white than a green. The blue which succeeded became very good, and of a very bright sky-colour, but yet something inferior to the former blue; and the violet was intense and deep with little or no redness in it. And less in quantity than the blue.
In the last red appeared a tincture of scarlet next to violet, which soon changed to a brighter Colour, inclining to an orange; and the yellow which followed was at first pretty good and lively, but afterwards it grew more dilute, until by degrees it ended in perfect <23> whiteness. And this whiteness, if the Water was very tenacious and well-tempered, would slowly spread and dilate it self over the greater part of the Bubble; continually growing paler at the top, where at length it would crack in many places, and those cracks, as they dilated, would appear of a pretty good, but yet obscure and dark sky-colour; the white between the blue Spots diminishing, until it resembled the threds of an irregular Net-work, and soon after vanished and left all the upper part of the Bubble of the said dark blue Colour. And this Colour, after the aforesaid manner, dilated it self downwards, until sometimes it hath overspread the whole Bubble. In the mean while at the top, which was of a darker blue than the bottom, and appeared also full of many round blue Spots, something darker than the rest, there would emerge one or more very black Spots, and within those other Spots of an intenser blackness, which I mentioned in the former Observation; and these continually dilated themselves until the Bubble broke.
If the Water was not very tenacious the black Spots would break forth in the white, without any sensible intervention of the blue. And sometimes they would break forth within the precedent yellow, or red, or perhaps within the blue of the second order, before the intermediate Colours had time to display themselves.
By this description you may perceive how great an affinity these Colours have with those of Air described in the fourth Observation, although set down in a contrary order, by reason that they begin to appear when the Bubble is thickest, and are most conve <24> niently reckoned from the lowest and thickest part of the Bubble upwards.
OBS. XIX.
Viewing in several oblique positions of my Eye the Rings of Colours emerging on the top of the Bubble, I found that they were sensibly dilated by increasing the obliquity, but yet not so much by far as those made by thin'd Air in the seventh Observation. For there they were dilated so much as, when viewed most obliquely, to arrive at a part of the plate more than twelve times thicker than that where they appeared when viewed perpendicularly; whereas in this case the thickness of the Water, at which they arrived when viewed most obliquely, was to that thickness which exhibited them by perpendicular rays, something less than as 8 to 5. By the best of my Observations it was between 15 and  to 10, an increase about 24 times less than in the other case.
Sometimes the Bubble would become of an uniform thickness all over, except at the top of it near the black Spot, as I knew, because it would exhibit the same appearance of Colours in all positions of the Eye. And then the Colours which were seen at its apparent circumference by the obliquest rays, would be different from those that were seen in other places, by rays less oblique to it. And divers Spectators might see the same part of it of differing Colours, by viewing it at very differing obliquities. Now observing how much the Colours at the same places of the Bubble, or at divers places of equal thickness, were varied by the <25> several obliquities of the rays; by the assistance of the 4th, 14th, 16th and 18th Observations, as they are hereafter explained, I collect the thickness of the Water requisite to exhibit any one and the same Colour, at several obliquities, to be very nearly in the proportion expressed in this Table.

In the two first Columns are expressed the obliquities of the rays to the Superficies of the Water, that is, their Angles of incidence and refraction. Where I suppose that the Sines which measure them are in round numbers as 3 to 4, though probably the dissolution of Soap in the Water, may a little alter its refractive Vertue. In the third Column the thickness of the Bubble, at which any one Colour is exhibited in those several obliquities, is expressed in parts, of which ten constitute its thickness when the rays are perpendicular.
I have sometimes observed, that the Colours which arise on polished Steel by heating it, or on Bell-metal, and some other metalline substances, when melted and <26> poured on the ground, where they may cool in the open Air, have, like the Colours of Water-bubbles, been a little changed by viewing them at divers obliquities, and particularly that a deep blue, or violet, when viewed very obliquely, hath been changed to a deep red. But the changes of these Colours are not so great and sensible as of those made by Water. For the Scoria or vitrified part of the Metal, which most Metals when heated or melted do continually protrude, and send out to their surface, and which by covering the Metals in form of a thin glassy skin, causes these Colours, is much denser than Water; and I find that the change made by the Obliquation of the Eye is least in Colours of the densest thin Substances.
OBS. XX.
As in the ninth Observation, so here, the Bubble, by transmitted Light, appeared of a contrary Colour to that which it exhibited by reflexion. Thus when the Bubble being looked on by the Light of the Clouds reflected from it, seemed red at its apparent circumference, if the Clouds at the same time, or immediately after, were viewed through it, the Colour at its circumference would be blue. And, on the contrary, when by reflected Light it appeared blue, it would appear red by transmitted Light.
OBS. XXI.
By wetting very thin plates of Muscovy-glass, whose thinness made the like Colours appear, the Colours <27> became more faint and languid; especially by wetting the plates on that side opposite to the Eye: But I could not perceive any variation of their species. So then the thickness of a plate requisite to produce any Colour, depends only on the density of the plate, and not on that of the ambient medium. And hence, by the 10th and 16th Observations, may be known the thickness which Bubbles of Water, or Plates of Muscovy-glass, or other substances, have at any Colour produced by them.
OBS. XXII.
A thin transparent Body, which is denser than its ambient medium, exhibits more brisque and vivid Colours than that which is so much rarer; as I have particularly observed in the Air and Glass. For blowing Glass very thin at a Lamp-furnace, those plates incompassed with Air did exhibit Colours much more vivid than those of Air made thin between two Glasses.
OBS. XXIII.
Comparing the quantity of Light reflected from the several Rings, I found that it was most copious from the first or inmost, and in the exterior Rings became gradually less and less. Also the whiteness of the first Ring was stronger than that reflected from those parts of the thinner medium were without the Rings; as I could manifestly perceive by viewing at a distance the Rings made by the two Object <28> Glasses; or by comparing two Bubbles of Water blown at distant times, in the first of which the whiteness appeared, which succeeded all the Colours, and in the other, the whiteness which preceded them all.
OBS. XXIV.
When the two Object-Glasses were lay'd upon one another, so as to make the Rings of the Colours appear, though with my naked Eye I could not discern above 8 or 9 of those Rings, yet by viewing them through a Prism I have seen a far greater multitude, insomuch that I could number more than forty, besides many others, that were so very small and close together, that I could not keep my Eye steddy on them severally so as to number them, but by their extent I have sometimes estimated them to be more than an hundred. And I believe the Experiment may be improved to the discovery of far greater numbers. For they seem to be really unlimited, though visible only so far as they can be separated by the refraction, as I shall hereafter explain.
But it was but one side of these Rings, namely, that towards which the refraction was made, which by that refraction was rendered distinct, and the other side became more confused than when viewed by the naked Eye, insomuch that there I could not discern above one or two, and sometimes none of those Rings, of which I could discern eight or nine with my naked Eye. And their Segments or Arcs, which on the other side appeared so numerous, for the most part <29> exceeded not the third part of a Circle. If the Refraction was very great, or the Prism very distant from the Object-Glasses, the middle part of those Arcs became also confused, so as to disappear and constitute an even whiteness, whilst on either side their ends, as also the whole Arcs furthest from the center, became distincter than before, appearing in the form as you see them designed in the fifth Figure.[Image 5]
The Arcs, where they seemed distinctest, were only white and black successively, without any other Colours intermixed. But in other places there appeared Colours, whose order was inverted by the refraction in such manner, that if I first held the Prism very near the Object-Glasses, and then gradually removed it further off towards my Eye, the Colours of the 2d, 3d, 4th, and following Rings shrunk towards the white that emerged between them, until they wholly vanished into it at the middle of the Arcs, and afterwards emerged again in a contrary order. But at the ends of the Arcs they retained their order unchanged.
I have sometimes so lay'd one Object-Glass upon the other, that to the naked Eye they have all over seemed uniformly white, without the least appearance of any of the coloured Rings; and yet by viewing them through a Prism, great multitudes of those Rings have discovered themselves. And in like manner plates of Muscovy-glass, and Bubbles of Glass blown at a Lamp-furnace, which were not so thin as to exhibit any Colours to the naked Eye, have through the Prism exhibited a great variety of them ranged irregularly up and down in the form of waves. And so <30> Bubbles of Water, before they began to exhibit their Colours to the naked Eye of a By-stander, have appeared through a Prism, girded about with many parallel and horizontal Rings; to produce which effect, it was necessary to hold the Prism parallel, or very nearly parallel to the Horizon, and to dispose it so that the rays might be refracted upwards.

Remarks upon the foregoing Observations.
HAving given my Observations of these Colours, before I make use of them to unfold the Causes of the Colours of natural Bodies, it is convenient that by the simplest of them, such as are the 2d, 3d, 4th, 9th, 12th, 18th, 20th, and 24th, I first explain the more expounded. And first to shew how the Colours in the fourth and eighteenth Observations are produced, let there be taken in any right line from the Point Y,[Image 1] the Lengths YA, YB, YC, YD, YE, YF, YG, YH, in proportion to one another, as the Cube-roots of the Squares of the numbers, , , , , , {}, , 1, whereby the lengths of a musical Chord to sound all the Notes in an Eighth are represented; that is, in the proportion of the numbers 6300, 6814, 7114, 7631, 8255, 8855, 9243, 10000. And at the Points A, B, C, D, <32> E, F, G, H, let perpendiculars Aα, Bβ, &c. be erected, by whose intervals the extent of the several Colours set underneath against them, is to be represented. Then divide the line Aα in such proportion as the numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, &c. set at the points of division denote. And through those divisions from Y draw Lines 1I, 2K, 3L, 5M, 6N, 7O, &c.
Now if A2 be supposed to represent the thickness of any thin transparent Body, at which the outmost violet is most copiously reflected in the first Ring, or Series of Colours, then by the 13th Observation HK, will represent its thickness, at which the utmost red is most copiously reflected in the same Series. Also by the 5th and 16th Observations, A6 and HN will denote the thicknesses at which those extreme Colours are most copiously reflected in the second Series, and A10 and HQ the thicknesses, at which they are most copiously reflected in the third Series, and so on. And the thickness at which any of the intermediate Colours are reflected most copiously, will, according to the 14th Observation, be defined by the distance of the line AH from the intermediate parts of the lines 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. against which the names of those Colours are written below.
But further, to define the latitude of these Colours in each Ring or Series, let A 1 design the least thickness, and A3 the greatest thickness, at which the extreme violet in the first Series is reflected, and let HI, and HL, design the like limits for the extreme red, and let the intermediate Colours be limited by the intermediate parts of the Lines 1I, and 3L, against which the names of those Colours are written, and so on: But <33> yet with this caution, that the reflexions be supposed strongest at the intermediate Spaces, 2K, 6N, 10Q, &c. and from thence to decrease gradually towards these limits, 1I, 3L, 5M, 7O, &c. on either side; where you must not conceive them to be precisely limited, but to decay indefinitely. And whereas I have assigned the same latitude to every Series, I did it, because although the Colours in the first series seem to be a little broader than the rest, by reason of a stronger reflexion there, yet that inequality is so insensible as scarcely to be determined by Observation.
Now according to this description, conceiving that the rays originally of several Colours are by turns reflected at the Spaces 1I L3, 5M, O7, 9P R11, &c. and transmitted at the Spaces AHI1, 3LM5, 7OP9, &c. it is easy to know what Colour must in the open Air be exhibited at any thickness of a transparent thin body. For if a Ruler be applied parallel to AH, at that distance from it by which the thickness of the body is represented, the alternate Spaces 1IL3, 5MO7, &c. which it crosseth will denote the reflected original Colours, of which the Colour exhibited in the open Air is compounded. Thus if the constitution of the green in the third Series of Colours be desired, apply the Ruler as you see at πρσφ, and by its passing through some of the blue at π and yellow at σ, as well as through the green at ρ, you may conclude that the green exhibited at that thickness of the body is principally constituted of original green, but not without a mixture of some blue and yellow.
<34>
By this means you may know how the Colours from the center of the Rings outward ought to succeed in order as they were described in the 4th and 18th Observations. For if you move the Ruler gradually from AH through all distances, having passed over the first space which denotes little or no reflexion to be made by thinnest substances, it will first arrive at 1 the violet, and then very quickly at the blue and green, which together with that violet compound blue, and then at the yellow and red, by whose further addition that blue is converted into whiteness, which whiteness continues during the transit of the edge of the Ruler from I to 3, and after that by the successive deficience of its component Colours, turns first to compound yellow, and then to red, and last of all the red ceaseth at L. Then begin the Colours of the second Series, which succeed in order during the transit of the edge of the Ruler from 5 to O, and are more lively than before, because more expanded and severed. And for the same reason, instead of the former white there intercedes between the blue and yellow a mixture of orange, yellow, green, blue and indico, all which together ought to exhibit a dilute and imperfect green. So the Colours of the third Series all succeed in order; first, the violet, which a little interferes with the red of the second order, and is thereby inclined to a reddish purple; then the blue and green, which are less mixed with other Colours, and consequently more lively than before, especially the green: Then follows the yellow, some of which towards the green is distinct and good, but that part of it towards the succeeding red, as also that red is mixed with the violet and blue of the fourth Se <35> ries, whereby various degrees of red very much inclining to purple are compounded. This violet and blue, which should succeed this red, being mixed with, and hidden in it, there succeeds a green. And this at first is much inclined to blue, but soon becomes a good green, the only unmixed and lively Colour in this fourth Series. For as it verges towards the yellow, it begins to interfere with the Colours of the fifth Series, by whose mixture the succeeding yellow and red are very much diluted and made dirty, especially the yellow, which being the weaker Colour is scarce able to shew it self. After this the several Series interfere more and more, and their Colours become more and more intermixed, till after three or four more revolutions (in which the red and blue predominate by turns) all sorts of Colours are in all places pretty equally blended, and compound an even whiteness.
And since by the 15th Observation the rays endued with one Colour are transmitted, where those of another Colour are reflected, the reason of the Colours made by the transmitted Light in the 9th and 20th Observations is from hence evident.
If not only the order and species of these Colours, but also the precise thickness of the plate, or thin body at which they are exhibited, be desired in parts of an Inch, that may be also obtained by assistance of the 6th or 16th Observations. For according to those Observations the thickness of the thinned Air, which between two Glasses exhibited the most luminous parts of the first six Rings were , , , ,   parts of an Inch. Suppose the Light reflected most copiously at these thicknesses be the bright citrine yellow, or con <36> fine of yellow and orange, and these thicknesses will be Gμ, Gν, Gξ, Gο, Gτ. And this being known, it is easy to determine what thickness of Air is represented by Gφ, or by any other distance of the Ruler from AH.
But further, since by the 10th Observation the thickness of Air was to the thickness of Water, which between the same Glasses exhibited the same Colour, as 4 to 3, and by the 21th Observation the Colours of thin bodies are not varied by varying the ambient medium; the thickness of a Bubble of Water, exhibiting any Colour, will be  of the thickness of Air producing the same Colour. And so according to the same 10th and 21th Observations the thickness of a plate of Glass, whose refraction of the mean refrangible ray, is measured by the proportion of the Sines 31 to 20, may be  of the thickness of Air producing the same Colours; and the like of other mediums. I do not affirm, that this proportion of 20 tO 31, holds in all the rays; for the Sines of other sorts of rays have other proportions. But the differences of those proportions are so little that I do not here consider them. On these Grounds I have composed the following Table, wherein the thickness of Air, Water, and Glass, at which each Colour is most intense and specifick, is expressed in parts of an Inch divided into ten hundred thousand equal parts.

Now if this Table be compared with the 6th Scheme, you will there see the constitution of each Colour, as to its Ingredients, or the original Colours of which it is compounded, and thence be enabled to judge of its intenseness or imperfection; which may suffice in explication of the 4th and 18th Observations, unless it be further desired to delineate the manner how the Colours appear, when the two Object-Glasses are lay'd upon one another. To do which, let there be described a large Arc of a Circle, and a streight Line which may touch that Arc, and parallel to that Tangent several occult Lines, at such distances from it, as the numbers set against the several Colours in the Table denote. For the Arc, and its Tangent, will represent the superficies of the Glasses terminating the interjacent Air; and the places where the occult Lines cut the Arc will show at what distances from the Center, or Point of contact, each Colour is reflected.
There are also other uses of this Table: For by its assistance the thickness of the Bubble in the 19th Observation was determined by the Colours which it exhibited. And so the bigness of the parts of natural Bodies may be conjectured by their Colours, as shall be hereafter shewn. Also, if two or more very thin plates be lay'd one upon another, so as to compose one plate equalling them all in thickness, the resulting Colour may be hereby determined. For instance, Mr. Hook in his Micrographia observes, that a faint yellow plate of Muscovy-glass lay'd upon a blue one, constituted a very deep purple. The yellow of the first Order is a faint one, and the thickness of the plate exhibiting it, according to the Table is , to which add 9, the thick <39> ness exhibiting blue of the second Order, and the sum will be , which is the thickness exhibiting the purple of the third Order.
To explain, in the next place, the Circumstances of the 2d and 3d Observations; that is, how the Rings of the Colours may (by turning the Prisms about their common Axis the contrary way to that expressed in those Observations) be converted into white and black Rings, and afterwards into Rings of Colours again, the Colours of each Ring lying now in an inverted order; it must be remembered, that those Rings of Colours are dilated by the obliquation of the rays to the Air which intercedes the Glasses, and that according to the Table in the 7th Observation, their dilatation or increase of their diameter is most manifest and speedy when they are obliquest. Now the rays of yellow being more refracted by the first superficies of the said Air than those of red, are thereby made more oblique to the second superficies, at which they are reflected to produce the coloured Rings, and consequently the yellow Circle in each Ring will be more dilated than the red; and the excess of its dilatation will be so much the greater, by how much the greater is the obliquity of the rays, until at last it become of equal extent with the red of the same Ring. And for the same reason the green, blue and violet, will be also so much dilated by the still greater obliquity of their rays, as to become all very nearly of equal extent with the red, that is, equally distant from the center of the Rings. And then all the Colours of the same Ring must be coincident, and by their mixture exhibit a white Ring. And these white Rings must have black and dark Rings between them, because they do not <40> spread and interfere with one another as before. And for that reason also they must become distincter and visible to far greater Numbers. But yet the violet being obliquest will be something more dilated in proportion to its extent than the other Colours, and so very apt to appear at the exterior verges of the white.
Afterwards, by a greater obliquity of the rays, the violet and blue become more sensibly dilated than the red and yellow, and so being further removed from the center of the Rings, the Colours must emerge out of the white in an order contrary to that which they had before, the violet and blue at the exterior limbs of each Ring,and the red and yellow at the interior. And the violet, by reason of the greatest obliquity of its rays, being in proportion most of all expanded, will soonest appear at the exterior limb of each white Ring, and become more conspicuous than the rest. And the several Series of Colours belonging to the several Rings, will, by their unfolding and spreading, begin again to interfere, and thereby render the Rings less distinct, and not visible to so great numbers.
If instead of the Prisms the Object-glasses be made use of, the Rings which they exhibit become not white and distinct by the obliquity of the Eye, by reason that the rays in their passage through that Air which intercedes the Glasses are very nearly parallel to those Lines in which they were first incident on the Glasses, and consequently the rays endued with several Colours are not inclined one more than another to that Air, as it happens in the Prisms.
There is yet another circumstance of these Experiments to be considered, and that is why the black and white <41> Rings which when viewed at a distance appear distinct, should not only become confused by viewing them near at hand, but also yield a violet Colour at both the edges of every white Ring. And the reason is, that the rays which enter the Eye at several parts of the Pupil, have several obliquities to the Glasses, and those which are most oblique, if considered apart, would represent the Rings bigger than those which are the least oblique. Whence the breadth of the perimeter of every white Ring is expanded outwards by the obliquest rays, and inwards by the least oblique. And this expansion is so much the greater by how much the greater is the difference of the obliquity; that is, by how much the Pupil is wider, or the Eye nearer to the Glasses. And the breadth of the violet must be most expanded, because the rays apt to excite a sensation of that Colour are most oblique to a second, or further superficies of the thin'd Air at which they are reflected, and have also the greatest variation of obliquity, which makes that Colour soonest emerge out of the edges of the white. And as the breadth of every Ring is thus augmented, the dark intervals must be diminished, until the neighbouring Rings become continuous, and are blended, the exterior first, and then those nearer the Center, so that they can no longer be distinguish'd apart, but seem to constitute an even and uniform whiteness.
Among all the Observations there is none accompanied with so odd circumstances as the 24th. Of those the principal are, that in thin plates, which to the naked Eye seem of an even and uniform transparent <42> whiteness, without any terminations of shadows, the refraction of a Prism should make Rings of Colours appear, whereas it usually makes Objects appear coloured only there where they are terminated with shadows, or have parts unequally luminous; and that it should make those Rings exceedingly distinct and white, although it usually renders Objects confused and coloured. The cause of these things you will understand by considering, that all the Rings of Colours are really in the plate, when viewed with the naked Eye, although by reason of the great breadth of their circumferences they so much interfere and are blended together, that they seem to constitute an even whiteness. But when the rays pass through the Prism to the Eye, the orbits of the several Colours in every Ring are refracted, some more than others, according to their degrees of refrangibility: By which means the Colours on one side of the Ring (that is on one side of its Center) become more unfolded and dilated, and those on the other side more complicated and contracted. And where by a due refraction they are so much contracted, that the several Rings become narrower than to interfere with one another, they must appear distinct, and also white, if the constituent Colours be so much contracted as to be wholly coincident. But, on the other side, where the orbit of every Ring is made broader by the further unfolding of its Colours, it must interfere more with other Rings than before, and so become less distinct.
To explain this a little further, suppose the concentrick Circles AV, and BX,[Image 2] represent the red and violet of any order, which, together with the intermediate <43> Colours, constitute any one of these Rings. Now these being viewed through a Prism, the violet Circle BX, will by a greater refraction be further translated from its place than the red AV, and so approach nearer to it on that side, towards which the refractions are made. For instance, if the red be translated to av, the violet may be translated to bx, so as to approach nearer to it at x than before, and if the red be further translated to av, the violet may be so much further translated to bx as to convene with it at x, and if the red be yet further translated to αY, the violet may be still so much further translated to βξ as to pass beyond it at ξ, and convene with it at e and f. And this being understood not only of the red and violet, but of all the other intermediate Colours, and also of every revolution of those Colours, you will easily perceive how those of the same revolution or order, by their nearness at xv and Yξ, and their coincidence at xv, e and f, ought to constitute pretty distinct Arcs of Circles, especially at xv, or at e and f, and that they will appear severally at xv, and at xv exhibit whiteness by their coincidence, and again appear several at Yξ, but yet in a contrary order to that which they had before, and still retain beyond e and f. But, on the other side, at ab, ab, or αβ, these Colours must become much more confused by being dilated and spread so, as to interfere with those of other Orders. And the same confusion will happen at Yξ between e and f, if the refraction be very great, or the Prism very distant from the Object-Glasses: In which case no parts of the Rings will be seen, save only two little Arcs at e and f, whose distance from one <44> another will be augmented by removing the Prism still further from the Object-Glasses: And these little Arcs must be distinctest and whitest at their middle, and at their ends, where they begin to grow confused they must be coloured. And the Colours at one end of every Arc must be in a contrary order to those at the other end, by reason that they cross in the intermediate white; namely their ends, which verge towards Yξ, will be red and yellow on that side next the Center, and blue and violet on the other side. But their other ends which verge from Yξ will on the contrary be blue and violet on that side towards the Center, and on the other side red and yellow.
Now as all these things follow from the Properties of Light by a mathematical way of reasoning, so the truth of them may be manifested by Experiments. For in a dark room, by viewing these Rings through a Prism, by reflexion of the several prismatique Colours, which an assistant causes to move to and fro upon a Wall or Paper from whence they are reflected, whilst the Spectator's Eye, the Prism and the Object-Glasses (as in the 13th Observation) are placed steddy: the position of the Circles made successively by the several Colours, will be found such, in respect of one another, as I have described in the Figures abxv, or abxv, or αβξY. And by the same method the truth of the Explications of other Observations may be examined.
By what hath been said the like Phænomena of Water, and thin plates of Glass may be understood. But in small fragments of those plates, there is this <45> further observable, that where they lye flat upon a Table and are turned about their Centers whilst they are viewed through a Prism, they will in some postures exhibit waves of various Colours, and some of them exhibit these waves in one or two Positions only, but the most of them do in all positions exhibit them, and make them for the most part appear almost all over the plates. The reason is, that the superficies of such plates are not even, but have many cavities and swellings, which how shallow soever do a little vary the thickness of the plate. For at the several sides of those cavities, for the reasons newly described, there ought to be produced waves in several postures of the Prism. Now though it be but some very small, and narrower parts of the Glass, by which these waves for the most part are caused, yet they may seem to extend themselves over the whole Glass, because from the narrowest of those parts there are Colours of several Orders that is of several Rings, confusedly reflected, which by refraction of the Prism are unfolded, separated, and according to their degrees of refraction, dispersed to several places, so as to constitute so many several waves, as there were divers orders of Colours promiscuously reflected from that part of the Glass.
These are the principal Phænomena of thin Plates or Bubbles, whose explications depend on the properties of Light, which I have heretofore delivered. And these you see do necessarily follow from them, and agree with them, even to their very least circumstances; and not only so, but do very much tend to their proof. Thus, by the 24th Observation, it appears, that the <46> rays of several Colours made as well by thin Plates or Bubbles, as by refractions of a Prism, have several degrees of refrangibility, whereby those of each order, which at the reflexion from the Plate or Bubble are intermixed with those of other orders, are separated from them by refraction, and associated together so as to become visible by themselves like Arcs of Circles. For if the rays were all alike refrangible, 'tis impossible that the whiteness, which to the naked sence appears uniform, should by refraction have its parts transposed and ranged into those black and white Arcs.
It appears also that the unequal refractions of difform rays proceed not from any contingent irregularities; such as are veins, an uneven polish, or fortuitous position of the pores of Glass; unequal and casual motions in the Air or Æther, the spreading, breaking, or dividing the same ray into many diverging parts, or the like. For, admitting any such irregularities, it would be impossible for refractions to render those Rings so very distinct, and well defined, as they do in the 24th Observation. It is necessary therefore that every ray have its proper and constant degree of refrangibility connate with it,according to which its refraction is ever justly and regularly performed, and that several rays have several of those degrees.
And what is said of their refrangibility may be also understood of their reflexibility, that is of their dispositions to be reflected some at a greater, and others at a less thickness, of thin Plates or Bubbles, namely, that those dispositions are also connate with the rays, and immutable; as may appear by the 13th, 14th, and <47> 15th Observations compared with the fourth and eighth.
By the precedent Observations it appears also, that whiteness is a dissimilar mixture of all Colours, and that Light is a mixture of rays indued with all those Colours. For considering the multitude of the Rings of Colours, in the 3d, 12th and 24th Observations, it is manifest that although in the 4th and 18th Observations there appear no more than eight or nine of those Rings, yet there are really a far greater number, which so much interfere and mingle with one another, as after those eight or nine revolutions to dilute one another wholly, and constitute an even and sensibly uniform whiteness. And consequently that whiteness must be allowed a mixture of all Colours, and the Light which conveys it to the Eye must be a mixture of rays indued with all those Colours.
But further, by the 24th Observation, it appears, that there is a constant relation between Colours and Refrangibility, the most refrangible rays being violet, the least refrangible red, and those of intermediate Colours having proportionably intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And by the 13th, 14th and 15th Observations, compared with the 4th or 18th, there appears to be the same constant relation between Colour and Reflexibility, the violet being in like circumstances reflected at least thicknesses of any thin Plate or Bubble, the red at greatest thicknesses, and the intermediate Colours at intermediate thicknesses. Whence it follows, that the colorifique dispositions of rays are also connate with them and immutable, and by consequence <48> that all the productions and appearances of Colours in the World are derived not from any physical change caused in Light by refraction or reflexion, but only from the various mixtures or separations of rays, by virtue of their different Refrangibility or Reflexibility. And in this respect the Science of Colours becomes a Speculation as truly mathematical as any other part of Optiques. I mean so far as they depend on the nature of Light, and are not produced or altered by the power of imagination, or by striking or pressing the Eyes.

PART III.
Of the permanent Colours of natural Bodies, and the Analogy between them and the Colours of thin transparent Plates.
I Am now come to another part of this Design, which is to consider how the Phænomena of thin transparent Plates stand related to those of all other natural Bodies. Of these Bodies I have already told you that they appear of divers Colours, accordingly as they are disposed to reflect most copiously the rays originally indued with those Colours. But their Constitutions, whereby they reflect some rays more copiously than others, remain to be discovered, and these I shall endeavour to manifest in the following Propositions.
<50>
PROP. I.
Those superficies of transparent Bodies reflect the greatest quantity of Light, which have the greatest refracting power; that is, which intercede mediums that differ most in their refractive densities. And in the confines of equally refracting mediums there is no reflexion.
The Analogy between reflexion and refraction will appear by considering, that when Light passeth obliquely out of one medium into another which refracts from the perpendicular, the greater is the difference of their refractive density, the less obliquity is requisite to cause a total reflexion. For as the Sines are which measure the refraction, so is the Sine of incidence at which the total reflexion begins, to the radius of the Circle, and consequently that incidence is least where there is the greatest difference of the Sines. Thus in the passing of Light out of Water into Air, where the refraction is measured by the Ratio of the Sines 3 to 4, the total reflexion begins when the Angle of incidence is about 48 degrees 35 minutes. In passing out of Glass into Air, where the refraction is measured by the Ratio of the Sines 20 to 31, the total reflexion begins when the Angle of incidence is 40 deg. 10 min. and so in passing out of crystal, or more strongly refracting mediums into Air, there is still a less obliquity requisite to cause a total reflexion. Superficies therefore which refract most do soonest reflect all the Light which is incident on them, and so must be allowed most strongly reflexive.
<51>
But the truth of this Proposition will further appear by observing, that in the superficies interceding two transparent mediums, such as are (Air, Water, Oyl, Common-Glass, Crystal, Metalline-Glasses, Island-Glasses, white transparent Arsnick, Diamonds, &c.) the reflexion is stronger or weaker accordingly, as the superficies hath a greater or less refracting power. For in the confine of Air and Sal-gemm 'tis stronger than in the confine of Air and Water, and still stronger in the confine of Air and Common-Glass or Crystal, and stronger in the confine of Air and a Diamond. If any of these, and such like transparent Solids, be immerged in Water, its reflexion becomes much weaker than before, and still weaker if they be immerged in the more strongly refracting Liquors of well-rectified Oyl of Vitriol or spirit of Turpentine. If Water be distinguished into two parts, by any imaginary surface, the reflexion in the confine of those two parts is none at all. In the confine of Water and Ice 'tis very little, in that of Water and Oyl 'tis something greater, in that of Water and Sal-gemm still greater, and in that of Water and Glass, or Crystal, or other denser substances still greater, accordingly as those mediums differ more or less in their refracting powers. Hence in the confine of Common-Glass and Crystal, there ought to be a weak reflexion, and a stronger reflexion in the confine of Common and Metalline-Glass, though I have not yet tried this. But, in the confine of two Glasses of equal density, there is not any sensible reflexion, as was shewn in the first Observation. And the same may be understood of the superficies interceding two Crystals, or two Liquors, or any other Substances in which no refraction is caused. So then the <52> reason why uniform pellucid mediums, (such as Water, Glass, or Crystal) have no sensible reflexion but in their external superficies, where they are adjacent to other mediums of a different density, is because all their contiguous parts have one and the same degree of density.
PROP. II.
The least parts of almost all natural Bodies are in some measure transparent: And the opacity of those Bodies ariseth from the multitude of reflexions caused in their internal Parts.
That this is so has been observed by others, and will easily be granted by them that have been conversant with Microscopes. And it may be also tryed by applying any substance to a Hole through which some Light is immitted into a dark room. For how opake soever that substance may seem in the open Air, it will by that means appear very manifestly transparent, if it be of a sufficient thinness. Only white metalline Bodies must be excepted, which by reason of their excessive density seem to reflect almost all the Light incident on their first superficies, unless by solution in menstruums they be reduced into very small particles, and then they become transparent.
PROP. III.
Between the parts of opake and coloured Bodies are many spaces, either empty or replenished, with mediums of other densities; as Water between the tinging corpuscles wherewith any Liquor is impregnated, Air between the <53> aqueous globules that constitute Clouds or Mists; and for the most part spaces void of both Air and Water, but yet perhaps not wholly void of all substance, between the parts of hard Bodies.
The truth of this is evinced by the two precedent Propositions: For by the second Proposition there are many reflexions made by the internal parts of Bodies, which, by the first Proposition, would not happen if the parts of those Bodies were continued without any such interstices between them, because reflexions are caused only in superficies, which intercede mediums of a differing density by Prop. I.
But further, that this discontinuity of parts is the principal cause of the opacity of Bodies, will appear by considering, that opake substances become transparent by filling their pores with any substance of equal or almost equal density with their parts. Thus Paper dipped in Water or Oyl, the Oculus mundi Stone steep'd in Water, Linnen-cloth oyled or varnished, and many other substances soaked in such Liquors as will intimately pervade their little pores, become by that means more transparent than otherwise; so, on the contrary, the most transparent substances may by evacuating their pores, or separating their parts, be rendered sufficiently opake, as Salts or wet Paper, or the Oculus mundi Stone by being dried, Horn by being scraped, Glass by being reduced to powder, or otherwise flawed, Turpentine by being stirred about with Water till they mix imperfectly, and Water by being formed into many small Bubbles, either alone in the form of froth, or by shaking it together with Oyl of Turpentine, or with some other convenient Liquor, with which it will <54> not perfectly incorporate. And to the increase of the opacity of these Bodies it conduces something, that by the 23d Observation the reflexions of very thin transparent substances are considerably stronger than those made by the same substances of a greater thickness.
PROP. IV.
The parts of Bodies and their Interstices must not be less than of some definite bigness, to render them opake and coloured.
For the opakest Bodies, if their parts be subtily divided, (as Metals by being dissolved in acid menstruums, &c.) become perfectly transparent. And you may also remember, that in the eighth Observation there was no sensible reflexion at the superficies of the Object-Glasses where they were very near one another, though they did not absolutely touch. And in the 17th Observation the reflexion of the Water-bubble where it became thinnest was almost insensible, so as to cause very black Spots to appear on the top of the Bubble by the want of reflected Light.
On these grounds I perceive it is that Water, Salt, Glass, Stones, and such like substances, are transparent. For, upon divers considerations, they seem to be as full of pores or interstices between their parts as other Bodies are, but yet their parts and interstices to be too small to cause reflexions in their common surfaces.
<55>
PROP. V.
The transparent parts of Bodies according to their several sizes must reflect rays of one Colour, and transmit those of another, on the same grounds that thin Plates or Bubbles do reflect or transmit those rays. And this I take to be the ground of all their Colours.
For if a thin'd or plated Body, which being of an even thickness, appears all over of one uniform Colour, should be slit into threads, or broken into fragments, of the same thickness with the plate; I see no reason why every thread or fragment should not keep its Colour, and by consequence why a heap of those threads or fragments should not constitute a mass or powder of the same Colour, which the plate exhibited before it was broken. And the parts of all natural Bodies being like so many fragments of a Plate, must on the same grounds exhibit the same Colours.
Now that they do so, will appear by the affinity of their properties. The finely coloured Feathers of some Birds, and particularly those of Peacocks Tails, do in the very same part of the Feather appear of several Colours in several positions of the Eye, after the very same manner that thin Plates were found to do in the 7th and 19th Observations, and therefore their Colours arise from the thinness of the transparent parts of the Feathers; that is, from the slenderness of the very fine Hairs, or Capillamenta, which grow out of the sides of the grosser lateral branches or fibres of those Feathers. And to the same purpose it is, that the Webs of some Spiders by <56> being spun very fine have appeared coloured, as some have observed, and that the coloured fibres of some silks by varying the position of the Eye do vary their Colour. Also the Colours of silks, cloths, and other substances, which Water or Oyl can intimately penetrate, become more faint and obscure by being immerged in those liquors, and recover their vigor again by being dried, much after the manner declared of thin Bodies in the 10th and 21St Observations. Leaf-gold, some sorts of painted Glass, the infusion of Lignum Nephriticum, and some other substances reflect one Colour, and transmit another, like thin Bodies in the 9th and 20th Observations. And some of those coloured powders which Painters use, may have their Colours a little changed, by being very elaborately and finely ground. Where I see not what can be justly pretended for those changes, besides the breaking of their parts into less parts by that contrition after the same manner that the Colour of a thin Plate is changed by varying its thickness. For which reason also it is that the coloured flowers of Plants and Vegitables by being bruised usually become more transparent than before, or at least in some degree or other change their Colours. Nor is it much less to my purpose, that by mixing divers liquors very odd and remarquable productions and changes of Colours may be effected, of which no cause can be more obvious and rational than the saline corpuscles of one liquor do variously act upon or unite with the tinging corpuscles of another, so as to make them swell, or shrink (whereby not only their bulk but their density also may be changed) or to divide them into smaller corpuscles, (whereby a coloured liquor may be <57> come transparent) or to make many of them associate into one cluster, whereby two transparent liquors may compose a coloured one. For we see how apt those saline menstruums are to penetrate and dissolve substances to which they are applied, and some of them to precipitate what others dissolve. In like manner, if we consider the various Phænomena of the Atmosphære, we may observe, that when Vapours are first raised, they hinder not the transparency of the Air, being divided into parts too small to cause any reflexion in their superficies. But when in order to compose drops of rain they begin to coalesce and constitute globules of all intermediate sizes, those globules when they become of convenient size to reflect some Colours and transmit others, may constitute Clouds of various Colours according to their sizes. And I see not what can be rationally conceived in so transparent a substance as Water for the production of these Colours, besides the various sizes of its fluid and globular Parcels.
PROP. VI.
The parts of Bodies on which their Colours depend, are denser than the medium, which pervades their interstices.
This will appear by considering, that the Colour of a Body depends not only on the rays which are incident perpendicularly on its parts, but on those also which are incident at all other Angles. And that according to the 7th Observation, a very little variation of obliquity will change the reflected Colour where the thin body or small particle is rarer than the ambient <58> medium, insomuch that such a small particle will at diversly oblique incidences reflect all sorts of Colours, in so great a variety that the Colour resulting from them all, confusedly reflected from a heap of such particles, must rather be a white or grey than any other Colour, or at best it must be but a very imperfect and dirty Colour. Whereas if the thin body or small particle be much denser than the ambient medium, the Colours according to the 19th Observation are so little changed by the variation of obliquity, that the rays which are reflected least obliquely may predominate over the rest so much as to cause a heap of such particles to appear very intensely of their Colour.
It conduces also something to the confirmation of this Proposition, that, according to the 22th Observation, the Colours exhibited by the denser thin body within the rarer, are more brisque than those exhibited by the rarer within the denser.
PROP. VII.
The bigness of the component parts of natural Bodies may be conjectured by their Colours.
For since the parts of these Bodies by Prop. 5. do most probably exhibit the same Colours with a Plate of equal thickness, provided they have the same refractive density; and since their parts seem for the most part to have much the same density with Water or Glass, as by many circumstances is obvious to collect; to determine the sizes of those parts you need only have recourse to the precedent Tables, in which the thickness of Water or Glass exhibiting any Colour is expressed. Thus <59> if it be desired to know the Diameter of a corpuscle, which being of equal density with Glass shall reflect green of the third order; the number  shews it to be  parts of an Inch.
The greatest difficulty is here to know of what order the Colour of any Body is. And for this end we must have recourse to the 4th and 18th Observations, from whence may be collected these particulars.
Scarlets, and other reds, oranges and yellows, if they be pure and intense are most probably of the second order. Those of the first and third order also may be pretty good, only the yellow of the first order is faint, and the orange and red of the third order have a great mixture of violet and blue.
There may be good greens of the fourth order, but the purest are of the third. And of this order the green of all Vegitables seem to be, partly by reason of the intenseness of their Colours, and partly because when they wither some of them turn to a greenish yellow, and others to a more perfect yellow or orange, or perhaps to red, passing first through all the aforesaid intermediate Colours. Which changes seem to be effected by the exhaling of the moisture which may leave the tinging corpuscles more dense, and something augmented by the accretion of the oyly and earthy part of that moisture. Now the green without doubt is of the same order with those Colours into which it changeth, because the changes are gradual, and those Colours, though usually not very full, yet are often too full and lively to be of the fourth order.
<60>
Blues and purples may be either of the second or third order, but the best are of the third. Thus the Colour of violets seems to be of that order, because their Syrup by acid Liquors turns red, and by urinous and alcalizale turns green. For since it is of the nature of Acids to dissolve or attenuate, and of Alcalies to precipitate or incrassate, if the purple Colour of the Syrup was of the second Order, an acid Liquor by attenuating its tinging corpuscles would change it to a red of the first order, and an Alcaly by incrassating them would change it to a green of the second order; which red and green, especially the green, seem too imperfect to be the Colours produced by these changes. But if the said purple be supposed of the third order, its change to red of the second, and green of the third, may without any inconvenience be allowed.
If there be found any Body of a deeper and less reddish purple than that of the violets, its Colour most probably is of the second order. But yet there being no Body commonly known whose Colour is constantly more deep than theirs, I have made use of their name to denote the deepest and least reddish purples, such as manifestly transcend their Colour in purity.
The blue of the first order, though very faint and little, may possibly be the Colour of some substances; and particularly the azure Colour of the Skys seems to be of this order. For all vapours when they begin to condense and coalesce into small parcels, become first of that bigness whereby such an Azure must be reflected before they can constitute Clouds of other Colours. And so this being the first Colour which vapours begin to reflect, it ought to be the Colour of the finest and most <61> transparent Skys in which vapours are not arrived to that grosness requisite to reflect other Colours, as we find it is by experience.
Whiteness, if most intense and luminous, is that of the first order, if less strong and luminous a mixture of the Colours of several orders. Of this last kind is the whiteness of Froth, Paper, Linnen, and most white substances; of the former I reckon that of white metals to be. For whilst the densest of metals, Gold, if foliated is transparent, and all metals become transparent if dissolved in menstruums or vitrified, the opacity of white metals ariseth not from their density alone. They being less dense than Gold would be more transparent than it, did not some other cause concur with their density to make them opake. And this cause I take to be such a bigness of their particles as fits them to reflect the white of the first order. For if they be of other thicknesses they may reflect other Colours, as is manifest by the Colours which appear upon hot Steel in tempering it, and sometimes upon the surface of melted metals in the Skin or Scoria which arises upon them in their cooling. And as the white of the first order is the strongest which can be made by Plates of transparent substances, so it ought to be stronger in the denser substances of metals than in the rarer of Air, Water and Glass. Nor do I see but that metallic substances of such a thickness as may fit them to reflect the white of the first order, may, by reason of their great density (according to the tenour of the first of these Propositions) reflect all the Light incident upon them, and so be as opake and splendent as its possible for any Body to be. Gold, or Copper mixed with less than half their weight <62> of Silver, or Tin, or Regulus of Antimony, in fusion or amalgamed with a very little Mercury become white; which shews both that the particles of white Metals have much more superficies, and so are smaller, than those of Gold and Copper, and also that they are so opake as not to suffer the particles of Gold or Copper to shine through them. Now it is scarce to be doubted, but that the Colours of Gold and Copper are of the second and third order, and therefore the particles of white metals cannot be much bigger than is requisite to make them reflect the white of the first order. The volatility of Mercury argues that they are not much bigger, nor may they be much less, lest they lose their opacity, and become either transparent as they do when attenuated by vitrification, or by solution in menstruums, or black as they do when ground smaller, by rubbing Silver,or Tin, or Lead, upon other substances to draw black Lines. The first and only Colour which white metals take by grinding their particles smaller is black, and therefore their white ought to be that which borders upon the black Spot in the center of the Rings of Colours, that is, the white of the first order. But if you would hence gather the bigness of metallic particles, you must allow for their density. For were Mercury transparent, its density is such that the Sine of incidence upon it (by my computation) would be to the sine of its refraction, as 71 to 20, or 7 to 2. And therefore the thickness of its particles, that they may exhibit the same Colours with those of Bubbles of Water, ought to be less than the thickness of the Skin of those Bubbles in the proportion of 2 to 7. Whence its possible that the particles of Mercury may be as little <63> as the particles of some transparent and volatile fluids, and yet reflect the white of the first order.
Lastly, for the production of black, the corpuscles must be less than any of those which exhibit Colours. For at all greater sizes there is too much Light reflected to constitute this Colour. But if they be supposed a little less than is requisite to reflect the white and very faint blue of the first order, they will, according to the 4th, 8th, 17th and 18th Observations, reflect so very little Light as to appear intensely black, and yet may perhaps variously refract it to and fro within themselves so long, until it happen to be stifled and lost, by which means they will appear black in all positions of the Eye without any transparency. And from hence may be understood why Fire, and the more subtile dissolver Putrefaction, by dividing the particles of substances, turn them to black, why small quantities of black substances impart their Colour very freely and intensely to other substances to which they are applied; the minute particles of these, by reason of their very great number, easily overspreading the gross particles of others; why Glass ground very elaborately with Sand on a Copper Plate, 'till it be well polished, makes the Sand, together with what is worn off from the Glass and Copper, become very black: why black substances do soonest of all others become hot in the Sun's Light and burn, (which effect may proceed partly from the multitude of refractions in a little room, and partly from the easy commotion of so very small corpuscles;) and why blacks are usually a little inclined to a bluish Colour. For that they are so may be seen by illuminating white Paper by Light reflected from black sub <64> stances. For the Paper will usually appear of a bluish white; and the reason is, that black borders on the obscure blue of the first order described in the 18th Observation, and therefore reflects more rays of that Colour than of any other.
In these Descriptions I have been the more particular, because it is not impossible but that Miscroscopes may at length be improved to the discovery of the particles of Bodies on which their Colours depend, if they are not already in some measure arrived to that degree of perfection. For if those Instruments are or can be so far improved as with sufficient distinctness to represent Objects five or six hundred times bigger than at a Foot distance they appear to our naked Eyes, I should hope that we might be able to discover some of the greatest of those corpuscles. And by one that would magnify three or four thousand times perhaps they might all be discovered, but those which produce blackness. In the mean while I see nothing material in this Discourse that may rationally be doubted of excepting this Position, That transparent corpuscles of the same thickness and density with a Plate, do exhibit the same Colour. And this I would have understood not without some latitude, as well because those corpuscles may be of irregular Figures, and many rays must be obliquely incident on them, and so have a shorter way through them than the length of their Diameters, as because the straitness of the medium pent in on all sides within such corpuscles may a little alter its motions or other qualities on which the reflexion depends. But yet I cannot much suspect the last, because I have observed of some small Plates of Muscovy-Glass which were of an <65> even thickness, that through a Microscope they have appeared of the same Colour at their edges and corners where the included medium was terminated, which they appeared of in other places. However it will add much to our satisfaction, if those corpuscles could be discovered with Microscopes; which if we shall at length attain to, I fear it will be the utmost improvement of this sense. For it seems impossible to see the more secret and noble works of nature within the corpuscles by reason of their transparency.
PROP. VIII.
The cause of Reflexion is not the impinging of Light on the solid or impervious parts of Bodies, as is commonly believed.
This will appear by the following Considerations. First, That in the passage of Light out of Glass into Air there is a reflexion as strong as in its passage out of Air into Glass, or rather a little stronger, and by many degrees stronger than in its passage out of Glass into Water. And it seems not probable that Air should have more reflecting parts than Water or Glass. But if that should possibly be supposed, yet it will avail nothing; for the reflexion is as strong or stronger when the Air is drawn away from the Glass, (suppose in the Air-pump invented by Mr. Boyle) as when it is adjacent to it. Secondly, If Light in its passage out of Glass into Air be incident more obliquely than at an Angle of 40 or 41 degrees it is wholly reflected, if less obliquely it is in great measure transmitted. Now it is not to be imagined that Light at one degree of obliquity should meet <66> with pores enough in the Air to transmit the greater part of it, and at another degree of obliquity should meet with nothing but parts to reflect it wholly, especially considering that in its passage out of Air into Glass, how oblique soever be its incidence, it finds pores enough in the Glass to transmit a great part of it. If any Man suppose that it is not reflected by the Air, but by the outmost superficial parts of the Glass, there is still the same difficulty: Besides, that such a Supposition is unintelligible, and will also appear to be false by applying Water behind some part of the Glass instead of Air. For so in a convenient obliquity of the rays suppose of 45 or 46 degrees, at which they are all reflected where the Air is adjacent to the Glass, they shall be in great measure transmitted where the Water is adjacent to it; which argues, that their reflexion or transmission depends on the constitution of the Air and Water behind the Glass, and not on the striking off the rays upon the parts of the Glass. Thirdly, If the Colours made by a Prism placed at the entrance of a beam of Light into a darkened room be successively cast on a second Prism placed at a greater distance from the former, in such manner that they are all alike incident upon it, the second Prism may be so inclined to the incident rays, that those which are of a blue Colour shall be all reflected by it, and yet those of a red Colour pretty copiously transmitted. Now if the reflexion be caused by the parts of Air or Glass, I would ask, why at the same obliquity of incidence the blue should wholly impinge on those parts so as to be all reflected, and yet the red find pores enough to be in a great measure transmitted. Fourthly, where two Glasses touch one <67> another, there is no sensible reflexion as was declared in the first Observation; and yet I see no reason why the rays should not impinge on the parts of Glass as much when contiguous to other Glass as when contiguous to Air. Fifthly, When the top of a Water-bubble (in the 17th Observation) by the continual subsiding and exhaling of the Water grew very thin, there was such a little and almost insensible quantity of Light reflected from it, that it appeared intensely black; whereas round about that black Spot, where the Water was thicker, the reflexion was so strong as to make the Water seem very white. Nor is it only at the least thickness of thin Plates or Bubbles, that there is no manifest reflexion, but at many other thicknesses continually greater and greater. For in the 15th Observation the rays of the same Colour were by turns transmitted at one thickness, and reflected at another thickness, for an indeterminate number of successions. And yet in the superficies of the thinned Body, where it is of any one thickness, there are as many parts for the rays to impinge on, as where it is of any other thickness. Sixthly, If reflexion were caused by the parts of reflecting Bodies, it would be impossible for thin Plates or Bubbles at the same place to reflect the rays of one Colour and transmit those of another, as they do according to the 13th and 15th Observations. For it is not to be imagined that at one place the rays which for instance exhibit a blue Colour, should have the fortune to dash upon the parts, and those which exhibit a red to hit upon the pores of the Body; and then at another place, where the Body is either a little thicker, or a little thinner, that on the contrary the blue should <68> hit upon its pores, and the red upon its parts. Lastly, were the rays of Light reflected by impinging on the solid parts of Bodies, their reflexions from polished Bodies could not be so regular as they are. For in polishing Glass with Sand, Putty or Tripoly, it is not to be imagined that those substances can by grating and fretting the Glass bring all its least particles to an accurate polish; so that all their surfaces shall be truly plain or truly spherical, and look all the same way, so as together to compose one even surface. The smaller the particles of those substances are, the smaller will be the scratches by which they continually fret and wear away the Glass until it be polished, but be they never so small they can wear away the Glass no otherwise than by grating and scratching it, and breaking the protuberances, and therefore polish it no otherwise than by bringing its roughness to a very fine Grain, so that the scratches and frettings of the surface become too small to be visible. And therefore if Light were reflected by impinging upon the solid parts of the Glass, it would be scattered as much by the most polished Glass as by the roughest. So then it remains a Problem, how Glass polished by fretting substances can reflect Light so regularly as it does. And this Problem is scarce otherwise to be solved than by saying, that the reflexion of a ray is effected, not by a single point of the reflecting Body, but by some power of the Body which is evenly diffused all over its surface, and by which it acts upon the ray without immediate contact. For that the parts of Bodies do act upon Light at a distance shall be shewn hereafter.
<69>
Now if Light be reflected not by impinging on the solid parts of Bodies, but by some other principle; its probable that as many of its rays as impinge on the solid parts of Bodies are not reflected but stifled and lost in the Bodies. For otherwise we must allow two sorts of reflexions. Should all the rays be reflected which impinge on the internal parts of clear Water or Crystal, those substances would rather have a cloudy Colour than a clear transparency. To make Bodies look black, its necessary that many rays be stopt, retained and lost in them, and it seems not probable that any rays can be stopt and stifled in them which do not impinge on their parts.
And hence we may understand that Bodies are much more rare and porous than is commonly believed. Water is 19 times lighter, and by consequence 19 times rarer than Gold, and Gold is so rare as very readily and without the least opposition to transmit the magnetick Effluvia, and easily to admit Quick-silver into its pores, and to let Water pass through it. For a concave Sphere of Gold filled with Water, and sodered up, has upon pressing the Sphere with great force, let the Water squeeze through it, and stand all over its outside in multitudes of small Drops, like Dew, without bursting or cracking the Body of the Gold as I have been informed by an Eye-witness. From all which we may conclude, that Gold has more pores than solid parts, and by consequence that Water has above forty times more pores than parts. And he that shall find out an Hypothesis, by which Water may be so rare, and yet not be capable of compression by force, may doubtless by the same Hypothesis make Gold and Water, and all <70> other Bodies as much rarer as he pleases, so that Light may find a ready passage through transparent substances.
PROP. IX.
Bodies reflect and refract Light by one and the same power variously exercised in various circumstances.
This appears by several Considerations. First, Because when Light goes out of Glass into Air, as obliquely as it can possibly do, if its incidence be made still more oblique, it becomes totally reflected. For the power of the Glass after it has refracted the Light as obliquely as is possible if the incidence be still made more oblique, becomes too strong to let any of its rays go through, and by consequence causes total reflexions. Secondly, Because Light is alternately reflected and transmitted by thin Plates of Glass for many successions accordingly, as the thickness of the Plate increases in an arithmetical Progression. For here the thickness of the Glass determines whether that power by which Glass acts upon Light shall cause it to be reflected, or suffer it to be transmitted. And, Thirdly, because those surfaces of transparent Bodies which have the greatest refracting power, reflect the greatest quantity of Light, as was shewed in the first Proposition.
PROP. X.
If Light be swifter in Bodies than in Vacuo in the proportion of the Sines which measure the refraction of the Bodies, the forces of the Bodies to reflect and refract Light, <71> are very nearly proportional to the densities of the same Bodies, excepting that unctuous and sulphureous Bodies refract more than others of this same density.
Let AB represent the refracting plane surface of any Body, and IC a ray incident very obliquely upon the  Body in C, so that the Angle ACI may be infinitely little, and let CR be the refracted ray. From a given Point B perpendicular to the refracting surface erect BR meeting with the refracted ray CR in R, and if CR represent the motion of the refracted ray, and this motion be distinguished into two motions CB and BR, whereof CB is parallel to the refracting plane, and BR perpendicular to it: CB shall represent the motion of the incident ray, and BR the motion generated by the refraction, as Opticians have of late explained.
Now if any Body or thing in moving through any space of a given breadth terminated on both sides by two parallel plains, be urged forward in all parts of that space by forces tending directly forwards towards the last plain, and before its incidence on the first plane, had no motion towards it, or but an infinitly little one; and if the forces in all parts of that space, between the planes be at equal distances from the planes equal to one another, but at several distances be bigger or less in any given proportion, the motion generated by the forces in the whole passage of the Body or thing <72> through that space shall be in a subduplicate proportion of the forces, as Mathematicians will easily understand. And therefore if the space of activity of the refracting superficies of the Body be considered as such a space, the motion of the ray generated by the refracting force of the Body, during its passage through that space, that is the motion BR, must be in subduplicate proportion of that refracting force. I say therefore that the square of the Line BR, and by consequence the refracting force of the Body is very nearly as the density of the same Body. For this will appear by the following Table, wherein the proportion of the Sines which measure the refraxions of several Bodies, the square of BR supposing CB an unite, the densities of the Bodies estimated by their specifick gravities, and their refractive power in respect of their densities are set down in several Columns.

The refraction of the Air in this Table is determined by that of the Atmosphere observed by Astronomers. For if Light pass through many refracting substances or mediums gradually denser and denser, and terminated <74> with parallel surfaces, the summ of all the refractions will be equal to the single refraction which it would have suffered in passing immediately out of the first medium into the last. And this holds true, though the number of the refracting substances be increased to infinity, and the distances from one another as much decreased, so that the Light may be refracted in every point of its passage, and by continual refractions bent into a curve Line. And therefore the whole refraction of Light in passing through the Atmosphere from the highest and rarest part thereof down to the lowest and densest part, must be equal to the refraction which it would suffer in passing at like obliquity out of a Vacuum immediately into Air of equal density with that in the lowest part of the Atmosphere.
Now, by this Table, the refractions of a Pseudo-Topaz, a Selenitis, Rock Crystal, Island Crystal, Vulgar Glass (that is, Sand melted together) and Glass of Antimony, which are terrestrial stony alcalizate concretes,and Air which probably arises from such substances by fermentation, be substances very differing from one another in density, yet have their refractive powers almost in the same proportion to one another as their densities are, excepting that the refraction of that strange substance Island-Crystal is a little bigger than the rest. And particularly Air, which is 3400 times rarer than the Pseudo-Topaz, and 4200 times rarer than Glass of Antimony, has notwithstanding its rarity the same refractive power in respect of its density which those two very dense substances have in respect of theirs, excepting so far as those differ from one another.
<75>
Again, the refraction of Camphire, Oyl-Olive, Lintseed Oyl, Spirit of Turpentine and Amber, which are fat sulphureous unctuous Bodies, and a Diamond, which probably is an unctuous substance coagulated, have their refractive powers in proportion to one another as their densities without any considerable variation. But the refractive powers of these unctuous substances are two or three times greater in respect of their densities than the refractive powers of the former substances in respect of theirs.
Water has a refractive power in a middle degree between those two sorts of substances, and probably is of a middle nature. For out of it grow all vegetable and animal substances, which consist as well of sulphureous fat and inflamable parts, as of earthy lean and alcalizate ones.
Salts and Vitriols have refractive powers in a middle degree between those of earthy substances and Water, and accordingly are composed of those two sorts of substances. For by distillation and rectification of their Spirits a great part of them goes into Water, and a great part remains behind in the form of a dry fixed earth capable of vitrification.
Spirit of Wine has a refractive power in a middle degree between those of Water and oyly substances, and accordingly seems to be composed of both, united by fermentation; the Water, by means of some saline Spirits with which 'tis impregnated, dissolving the Oyl, and volatizing it by the action. For Spirit of Wine is inflamable by means of its oyly parts, and being distilled often from Salt of Tartar, grows by every distillation more and more aqueous and phlegmatick. And <76> Chymists observe, that Vegitables (as Lavender, Rue, Marjoram, &c). distilled per se, before fermentation yield Oyls without any burning Spirits, but after fermentation yield ardent Spirits without Oyls: Which shews, that their Oyl is by fermentation converted into Spirit. They find also, that if Oyls be poured in a small quantity upon fermentating Vegetables, they distil over after fermentation in the form of Spirits.
So then, by the foregoing Table, all Bodies seem to have their refractive powers proportional to their densities, (or very nearly;) excepting so far as they partake more or less of sulphurous oyly particles, and thereby have their refractive power made greater or less. Whence it seems rational to attribute the refractive power of all Bodies chiefly, if not wholly, to the sulphurous parts with which they abound. For it's probable that all Bodies abound more or less with Sulphurs. And as Light congregated by a Burning-glass acts most upon sulphurous Bodies, to turn them into fire and flame; so, since all action is mutual, Sulphurs ought to act most upon Light. For that the action between Light and Bodies is mutual, may appear from this Consideration, That the densest Bodies which refract and reflect Light most strongly grow hottest in the Summer-Sun, by the action of the refracted or reflected Light.
I have hitherto explained the power of Bodies to reflect and refract, and shewed, that thin transparent plates, fibres and particles do, according to their several thicknesses and densities, reflect several sorts of rays, and thereby appear of several Colours, and by consequence that nothing more is requisite for producing all <77> the Colours of natural Bodies than the several sizes and densities of their transparent particles. But whence it is that these plates, fibres and particles do, according to their several thicknesses and densities, reflect several sorts of rays, I have not yet explained. To give some insight into this matter, and make way for understanding the next Part of this Book, I shall conclude this Part with a few more Propositions. Those which preceded respect the nature of Bodies, these the nature of Light: For both must be understood before the reason of their actions upon one another can be known. And because the last Proposition depended upon the velocity of Light, I will begin with a Proposition of that kind.
PROP. XI.
Light is propagated from luminous Bodies in time, and spends about seven or eight minutes of an hour in passing from the Sun to the Earth.
This was observed first by Romer, and then by others, by means of the Eclipses of the Satellites of Jupiter. For these Eclipses, when the Earth is between the Sun and Jupiter, happen about seven or eight minutes sooner than they ought to do by the Tables, and when the Earth is beyond the Sun they happen about seven or eight minutes later than they ought to do; the reason being, that the Light of the Satellites has farther to go in the latter case than in the former by the Diameter of the Earth's Orbit. Some inequalities of time may arise from the excentricities of the Orbs of the Satellites; but those cannot answer in all the Satellites, and at all times <78> to the position and distance of the Earth from the Sun. The mean motions of Jupiter's Satellites is also swifter in his descent from his Aphelium to his Perihelium, than in his ascent in the other half of his Orb: But this inequality has no respect to the position of the Earth, and in the three interior Satellites is insensible, as I find by computation from the Theory of their gravity.
PROP. XII.
Every ray of Light in its passage through any refracting surface is put into a certain transient constitution or state, which in the progress of the ray returns at equal intervals, and disposes the ray at every return to be easily transmitted through the next refracting surface, and between the returns to be easily reflected by it.
This is manifest by the 5th, 9th, 12th and 15th Observations. For by those Observations it appears, that one and the same sort of rays at equal Angles of incidence on any thin transparent plate, is alternately reflected and transmitted for many successions accordingly, as the thickness of the plate increases in arithmetical progression of the numbers, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, &c. so that if the first reflexion (that which makes the first or innermost of the Rings of Colours there described) be made at the thickness 1, the rays shall be transmitted at the thicknesses 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. and thereby make the central Spot and Rings of Light, which appear by transmission, and be reflected at the thickness 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, &c. and thereby make the Rings which <79> appear by reflexion. And this alternate reflexion and transmission, as I gather by the 24th Observation, continues for above an hundred vicissitudes, and by the Observations in the next part of this Book, for many thousands, being propagated from one surface of a Glass plate to the other, though the thickness of the plate be a quarter of an Inch or above: So that this alternation seems to be propagated from every refracting surface to all distances without end or limitation.
This alternate reflexion and refraction depends on both the surfaces of every thin plate, because it depends on their distance. By the 21st Observation, if either surface of a thin plate of Muscovy-Glass be wetted, the Colours caused by the alternate reflexion and refraction grow faint, and therefore it depends on them both.
It is therefore performed at the second surface, for if it were performed at the first, before the rays arrive at the second, it would not depend on the second.
It is also influenced by some action or disposition, propagated from the first to the second, because otherwise at the second it would not depend on the first. And this action or disposition, in its propagation, intermits and returns by equal intervals, because in all its progress it inclines the ray at one distance from the first surface to be reflected by the second, at another to be transmitted by it, and that by equal intervals for innumerable vicissitudes. And because the ray is disposed to reflexion at the distances 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. and to transmission at the distances 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c, (for its transmission through the first surface, is at the di <80> stance 0, and it is transmitted through both together, if their distance be infinitely little or much less than 1) the disposition to be transmitted at the distances 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, &c. is to be accounted a return of the same disposition which the ray first had at the distance 0, that is at its transmission through the first refracting surface. All which is the thing I would prove.
What kind of action or disposition this is? Whether it consists in a circulating or a vibrating motion of the ray, or of the medium, or something else? I do not here enquire. Those that are averse from assenting to any new discoveries, but such as they can explain by an Hypothesis, may for the present suppose, that as Stones by falling upon Water put the Water into an undulating motion, and all Bodies by percussion excite vibrations in the Air; so the rays of Light, by impinging on any refracting or reflecting surface, excite vibrations in the refracting or reflecting medium or substance, and by exciting them agitate the solid parts of the refracting or reflecting Body, and by agitating them cause the Body to grow warm or hot; that the vibrations thus excited are propagated in the refracting or reflecting medium or substance, much after the manner that vibrations are propagated in the Air for causing sound, and move faster than the rays so as to overtake them; and that when any ray is in that part of the vibration which conspires with its motion, it easily breaks through a refracting surface, but when it is in the contrary part of the vibration which impedes its motion, it is easily reflected; and, by consequence, that every ray is successively disposed to be easily reflected, or easily transmitted, by every vibration which overtakes it. But <81> whether this Hypothesis be true or false I do not here consider. I content my self with the bare discovery, that the rays of Light are by some cause or other alternately disposed to be reflected or refracted for many vicissitudes.
DEFINITION.
The returns of the disposition of any ray to be reflected I will call its Fits of easy reflexion, and those of its disposition to be transmitted its Fits of easy transmission, and the space it passes between every return and the next return, the Interval of its Fits.
PROP. XIII.
The reason why the surfaces of all thick transparent Bodies reflect part of the Light incident on them, and refract the rest, is, that some rays at their incidence are in Fits of easy reflexion, and others in Fits of easy transmission.
This may be gathered from the 24th Observation, where the Light reflected by thin plates of Air and Glass, which to the naked Eye appeared evenly white all over the plate, did through a Prism appear waved with many successions of Light and Darkness made by alternate fits of easy reflexion and easy transmission, the Prism severing and distinguishing the waves of which the white reflected Light was composed, as was explained above.
<82>
And hence Light is in fits of easy reflexion and easy transmission, before its incidence on transparent Bodies. And probably it is put into such fits at its first emission from luminous Bodies, and continues in them during all its progress. For these fits are of a lasting Nature, as will appear by the next part of this Book.
In this Proposition I suppose the transparent Bodies to be thick, because if the thickness of the Body be much less than the interval of the fits of easy reflexion and transmission of the rays, the Body loseth its reflecting power. For if the rays, which at their entering into the Body are put into fits of easy transmission, arrive at the furthest surface of the Body before they be out of those fits they must be transmitted. And this is the reason why Bubbles of Water lose their reflecting power when they grow very thin, and why all opake Bodies when reduced into very small parts become transparent.
PROP. XIV.
Those surfaces of transparent Bodies, which if the ray be in a fit of refraction do refract it most strongly, if the ray be in a fit of reflexion do reflect it most easily.
For we shewed above in Prop. 8. that the cause of reflexion is not the impinging of Light on the solid impervious parts of Bodies, but some other power by which those solid parts act on Light at a distance. We shewed also in Prop. 9. that Bodies reflect and refract Light by one and the same power variously exercised in various circumstances, and in Prop. 1. that the most strongly refracting surfaces reflect the most Light: All <83> which compared together evince and ratify both this and the last Proposition.
PROP. XV.
In any one and the same sort of rays emerging in any Angle out of any refracting surface into one and the same medium, the interval of the following fits of easy reflexion and transmission are either accurately or very nearly, as the Rectangle of the secant of the Angle of refraction, and of the secant of another Angle, whose sine is the first of 106 arithmetical mean proportionals, between the sines of incidence and refraction counted from the sine of refraction.
This is manifest by the 7th Observation.
PROP. XVI.
In several sorts of rays emerging in equal Angles out of any refracting surface into the same medium, the intervals of the following fits of easy reflexion and easy transmission are either accurately, or very nearly, as the Cube-roots of the Squares of the lengths of a Chord, which sound the notes in an Eight, sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, with all their imtermediate degrees answering to the Colours of those rays, according to the Analogy described in the seventh Experiment of the second Book.
This is manifest by the 13th and 14th Observations.
<84>
PROP. XVII.
If rays of any sort pass perpendicularly into several mediums, the intervals of the fits of easy reflexion and transmission in any one medium, are to those intervals in an other as the sine of incidence to the sine of refraction, when the rays pass out of the first of those two mediums into the second.
This is manifest by the 10th Observation.
PROP. XVIII.
If the rays which paint the Colour in the confine of yellow and orange pass perpendicularly out of any medium into Air, the intervals of their fits of easy reflexion are the th part of an Inch. And of the same length are the intervals of their fits of easy transmission.
This is manifest by the 6th Observation.
From these Propositions it is easy to collect the intervals of the fits of easy reflexion and easy transmission of any sort of rays refracted in any angle into any medium, and thence to know, whether the rays shall be reflected or transmitted at their subsequent incidence upon any other pellucid medium. Which thing being useful for understanding, the next part of this Book was here to be set down. And for the same reason I add the two following Propositions.
<85>
PROP. XIX.
If any sort of rays falling on the polite surface of any pellucid medium be reflected back, the fits of easy reflexion which they have at the point of reflexion, shall still continue to return, and the returns shall be at distances from the point of reflexion in the arithmetical progression of the numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, &c. and between these fits the rays shall be in fits of easy transmission.
For since the fits of easy reflexion and easy transmission are of a returning nature, there is no reason why these fits, which continued till the ray arrived at the reflecting medium, and there inclined the ray to reflexion, should there cease. And if the ray at the point of reflexion was in a fit of easy reflexion, the progression of the distances of these fits from that point must begin from 0, and so be of the numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. And therefore the progression of the distances of the intermediate fits of easy transmission reckoned from the same point, must be in the progression of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, &c. contrary to what happens when the fits are propagated from points of refraction.
PROP. XX.
The intervals of the fits of easy reflexion and easy transmission, propagated from points of reflexion into any medium, are equal to the intervals of the like fits which the same rays would have, if refracted into the same <86> medium in Angles of refraction equal to their Anales of reflexion.
For when Light is reflected by the second surface of thin plates, it goes out afterwards freely at the first surface to make the Rings of Colours which appear by reflexion, and by the freedom of its egress, makes the Colours of these Rings more vivid and strong than those which appear on the other side of the plates by the transmitted Light. The reflected rays are therefore in fits of easy transmission at their egress; which would not always happen, if the intervals of the fits within the plate after reflexion were not equal both in length and number to their intervals before it. And this confirms also the proportions set down in the former Proposition. For if the rays both in going in and out at the first surface be in fits of easy transmission, and the intervals and numbers of those fits between the first and second surface, before and after reflexion, be equal; the distances of the fits of easy transmission from either surface, must be in the same progression after reflexion as before; that is, from the first surface which transmitted them, in the progression of the even numbers 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, &c. and from the second which reflected them, in that of the odd numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, &c. But these two Propositions will become much more evident by the Observations in the following part of this Book.

Observations concerning the Reflexions and Colours of thick transparent polished Plates.
THere is no Glass or Speculum how well soever polished, but, besides the Light which it refracts or reflects regularly, scatters every way irregularly a faint Light, by means of which the polished surface, when illuminated in a dark Room by a beam of the Sun's Light, may be easily seen in all positions of the Eye. There are certain Phænomena of this scattered Light, which when I first observed them, seemed very strange and surprising to me. My Observations were as follows.
<88>
OBS. I.
The Sun shining into my darkened Chamber through a Hole  of an Inch wide, I let the intromitted beam of Light fall perpendicularly upon a Glass Speculum ground concave on one side and convex on the other, to a Sphere of five Feet and eleven Inches Radius, and quick-silvered over on the convex side. And holding a white opake Chart, or a Quire of Paper at the Center of the Spheres to which the Speculum was ground, that is, at the distance of about five Feet and eleven Inches from the Speculum, in such manner, that the beam of Light might pass through a little Hole made in the middle of the Chart to the Speculum, and thence be reflected back to the same Hole : I observed upon the Chart four or five concentric Irises or Rings of Colours, like Rain-bows, encompassing the Hole much after the manner that those, which in the fourth and following Observations of the first part of this third Book appeared between the Object-Glasses, encompassed the black Spot, but yet larger and fainter than those. These Rings as they grew larger and larger became diluter and fainter, so that the fifth was scarce visible. Yet sometimes, when the Sun shone very clear, there appeared faint Lineaments of a sixth and seventh. If the distance of the Chart from the Speculum was much greater or much less than that of six Feet, the Rings became dilute and vanished. And if the distance of the Speculum from the Window was much greater than that of six Feet, the reflected beam of Light would be so broad at the distance of six Feet from the Speculum where the Rings <89> appeared, as to obscure one or two of the innermost Rings. And therefore I usually placed the Speculum at about six Feet from the Window; so that its Focus might there fall in with the center of its concavity at the Rings upon the Chart. And this posture is always to be understood in the following Observations where no other is exprest.
OBS. II.
The Colours of these Rain-bows succeeded one another from the center outwards, in the same form and order with those which were made in the ninth Observation of the first Part of this Book by Light not reflected, but transmitted through the two Object-Glasses. For, first, there was in their common center a white round Spot of faint Light, something broader than the reflected beam of Light; which beam sometimes fell upon the middle of the Spot, and sometimes by a little inclination of the Speculum receded from the middle, and left the Spot white to the center.
This white Spot was immediately encompassed with a dark grey or russet, and that darkness with the Colours of the first Iris, which were on the inside next the darkness a little violet and indico, and next to that a blue, which on the outside grew pale, and then succeeded a little greenish yellow, and after that a brighter yellow, and then on the outward edge of the Iris a red which on the outside inclined to purple.
This Iris was immediately encompassed with a second, whose Colours were in order from the inside <90> outwards, purple, blue, green, yellow, light red, a red mixed with purple.
Then immediately followed the Colours of the third Iris, which were in order outwards a green inclining to purple, a good green, and a red more bright than that of the former Iris.
The fourth and fifth Iris seemed of a bluish green within, and red without, but so faintly that it was difficult to discern the Colours.
OBS. III.
Measuring the Diameters of these Rings upon the Chart as accurately as I could, I found them also in the same proportion to one another with the Rings made by Light transmitted through the two Object-Glasses. For the Diameters of the four first of the bright Rings measured between the brightest parts of their orbits, at the distance of six Feet from the Speculum were , , ,  Inches, whose squares are in arithmetical progression of the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4. If the white circular Spot in the middle be reckoned amongst the Rings, and its central Light, where it seems to be most luminous, be put equipollent to an infinitely little Ring; the squares of the Diameters of the Rings will be in the progression 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, &c. I measured also the Diameters of the dark Circles between these luminous ones, and found their squares in the progression of the numbers , , , , &c. the Diameters of the first four at the distance of six Feet from the Speculum, being , , ,  Inches. If the distance of the Chart from the Speculum was in <91> creased or diminished, the Diameters of the Circles were increased or diminished proportionally.
OBS. IV.
By the analogy between these Rings and those described in the Observations of the first Part of this Book, I suspected that there were many more of them which spread into one another, and by interfering mixed their Colours, and diluted one another so that they could not be seen apart. I viewed them therefore through a Prism, as I did those in the 24th Observation of the first Part of this Book. And when the Prism was so placed as by refracting the Light of their mixed Colours to separate them, and distinguish the Rings from one another, as it did those in that Observation, I could then see them distincter than before, and easily number eight or nine of them, and sometimes twelve or thirteen. And had not their Light been so very faint, I question not but that I might have seen many more.
OBS. V.
Placing a Prism at the Window to refract the intromitted beam of Light, and cast the oblong Spectrum of Colours on the Speculum: I covered the Speculum with a black Paper which had in the middle of it a Hole to let any one of the Colours pass through to the Speculum, whilst the rest were intercepted by the Paper. And now I found Rings of that Colour only which fell upon the Speculum. If the Speculum was illuminated with red the Rings were totally red with dark inter <92> vals, if with blue they were totally blue, and so of the other Colours. And when they were illuminated with any one Colour, the Squares of their Diameters measured between their most luminous parts, were in the arithmetical progression of the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and the Squares of the Diameters of their dark intervals in the progression of the intermediate numbers , , , : But if the Colour was varied they varied their magnitude. In the red they were largest, in the indico and violet least, and in the intermediate Colours yellow, green and blue; they were of several intermediate bignesses answering to the Colour, that is, greater in yellow than in green, and greater in green than in blue. And hence I knew that when the Speculum was illuminated with white Light, the red and yellow on the outside of the Rings were produced by the least refrangible rays, and the blue and violet by the most refrangible, and that the Colours of each Ring spread into the Colours of the neighbouring Rings on either side, after the manner explained in the first and second Part of this Book, and by mixing diluted one another so that they could not be distinguished, unless near the center where they were least mixed. For in this Observation I could see the Rings more distinctly, and to a greater number than before, being able in the yellow Light to number eight or nine of them, besides a faint shadow of a tenth. To satisfy my self how much the Colours of the several Rings spread into one another, I measured the Diameters of the second and third Rings, and found them when made by the confine of the red and orange to be to the same Diameters when made by the confine of blue and indico, as 9 to 8, or thereabouts. For it was hard <93> to determine this proportion accurately. Also the Circles made successively by the red, yellow and green, differed more from one another than those made successively by the green, blue and indico. For the Circle made by the violet was too dark to be seen. To carry on the computation, Let us therefore suppose that the differences of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red, the confine of red and orange, the confine of orange and yellow, the confine of yellow and green, the confine of green and blue, the confine of blue and indico, the confine of indico and violet, and outmost violet, are in proportion as the differences of the lengths of a Monochord which sound the tones in an Eight; sol, la, fa, sol, la, mi, fa, sol, that is, as the numbers , , {}, , , , . And if the Diameter of the Circle made by the confine of red and orange be 9A, and that of the Circle made by the confine of blue and indico be 8A as above, their difference 9A ---- 8A will be to the difference of the Diameters of the Circles made by the outmost red, and by the confine of red and orange, as  to , that is as  to  or 8 to 3, and to the difference of the Circles made by the outmost violet, and by the confine of blue and indico, as  to , that is, as  to , or as 16 to 5. And therefore these differences will be A and A. Add the first to 9A and subduct the last from 8A, and you will have the Diameters of the Circles made by the least and most refrangible rays A and A. These Diameters are therefore to one another as 75 to  or 50 to 41, and their Squares as 2500 to 1681, that is, as 3 to 2 very nearly. Which proportion differs not much from the proportion of the Diameters of the <94> Circles made by the outmost red and outmost violet in the 13th Observation of the first part of this Book.
OBS. VI.
Placing my Eye where these Rings appeared plainest, I saw the Speculum tinged all over with waves of Colours (red, yellow, green, blue;) like those which in the Observations of the first Part of this Book appeared between the Object-Glasses and upon Bubbles of Water, but much larger. And after the manner of those, they were of various magnitudes in various positions of the Eye, swelling and shrinking as I moved my Eye this way and that way. They were formed like Arcs of concentrick Circles as those were, and when my Eye was over against the center of the concavity of the Speculum (that is, 5 Feet and 10 Inches distant from the Speculum) their common center was in a right Line with that center of concavity, and with the Hole in the Window. But in other postures of my Eye their center had other positions. They appeared by the Light of the Clouds propagated to the Speculum through the Hole in the Window, and when the Sun shone through that Hole upon the Speculum, his Light upon it was of the Colour of the Ring whereon it fell, but by its splendor obscured the Rings made by the Light of the Clouds, unless when the Speculum was removed to a great distance from the Window, so that his Light upon it might be broad and faint. By varying the position of my Eye, and moving it nearer to or farther from the direct beam of the Sun's Light, the Colour of the Sun's reflected Light constantly varied upon the Speculum, <95> as it did upon my Eye, the same Colour always appearing to a By-stander upon my Eye which to me appeared upon the Speculum. And thence I knew that the Rings of Colours upon the Chart were made by these reflected Colours propagated thither from the Speculum in several Angles, and that their production depended not upon the termination of Light and Shadow.
OBS. VII.
By the Analogy of all these Phænomena with those of the like Rings of Colours described in the first Part of this Book, it seemed to me that these Colours were produced by this thick plate of Glass, much after the manner that those were produced by very thin plates. For, upon tryal, I found that if the Quick-silver were rubbed off from the back-side of the Speculum, the Glass alone would cause the same Rings of Colours, but much more faint than before; and therefore the Phænomenon depends not upon the Quick-silver, unless so far as the Quick-silver by increasing the reflexion of the back-side of the Glass increases the Light of the Rings of Colours. I found also that a Speculum of metal without Glass made some years since for optical uses, and very well wrought, produced none of those Rings; and thence I understood that these Rings arise not from one specular surface alone, but depend upon the two surfaces of the plate of Glass whereof the Speculum was made, and upon the thickness of the Glass between them. For as in the 7th and 19th Observations of the first Part of this Book a thin plate <96> of Air, Water, or Glass of an even thickness appeared of one Colour when the rays were perpendicular to it, of another when they were a little oblique, of another when more oblique, of another when still more oblique, and so on; so here, in the sixth Observation, the Light which emerged out of the Glass in several obliquities, made the Glass appear of several Colours, and being propagated in those obliquities to the Chart, there painted Rings of those Colours. And as the reason why a thin plate appeared of several Colours in several obliquities of the rays,was,that the rays of one and the same sort are reflected by the thin plate at one obliquity and transmitted at another, and those of other sorts transmitted where these are reflected, and reflected where these are transmitted: So the reason why the thick plate of Glass whereof the Speculum was made did appear of various Colours in various obliquities, and in those obliquities propagated those Colours to the Chart, was, that the rays of one and the same sort did at one obliquity emerge out of the Glass, at another did not emerge but were reflected back towards the Quick-silver by the hither surface of the Glass, and accordingly as the obliquity became greater and greater emerged and were reflected alternately for many successions, and that in one and the same obliquity the rays of one sort were reflected, and those of another transmitted. This is manifest by the first Observation of this Book: For in that Observation, when the Speculum was illuminated by any one of the prismatick Colours, that Light made many Rings of the same Colour upon the Chart with dark intervals, and therefore at its emergence out of the Speculum was alternately transmitted, and not <97> transmitted from the Speculum to the Chart for many successions, according to the various obliquities of its emergence. And when the Colour cast on the Speculum by the Prism was varied, the Rings became of the Colour cast on it, and varied their bigness with their Colour, and therefore the Light was now alternately transmitted and not transmitted from the Speculum to the Lens at other obliquities than before. It seemed to me therefore that these Rings were of one and the same original with those of thin plates, but yet with this difference that those of thin plates are made by the alternate reflexions and transmissions of the rays at the second surface of the plate after one passage through it, but here the rays go twice through the plate before they are alternately reflected and transmitted; first, they go through it from the first surface to the Quick-silver, and then return through it from the Quick-silver to the first surface, and there are either transmitted to the Chart or reflected back to the Quick-silver, accordingly as they are in their fits of easy reflexion or transmission when they arrive at that surface. For the intervals of the fits of the rays which fall perpendicularly on the Speculum, and are reflected back in the same perpendicular Lines, by reason of the equality of these Angles and Lines,are of the same length and number within the Glass after reflexion as before by the 19th Proposition of the third Part of this Book. And therefore since all the rays that enter through the first surface are in their fits of easy transmission at their entrance, and as many of these as are reflected by the second are in their fits of easy reflexion there, all these must be again in their fits of easy transmission at their <98> return to the first, and by consequence there go out of the Glass to the Chart, and form upon it the white Spot of Light in the center of the Rings. For the reason holds good in all sorts of rays, and therefore all sorts must go out promiscuously to that Spot, and by their mixture cause it to be white. But the intervals of the fits of those rays which are reflected more obliquely than they enter, must be greater after reflexion than before by the 15th and 20th Prop. And thence it may happen that the rays at their return to the first surface, may in certain obliquities be in fits of easy reflexion, and return back to the Quick-silver, and in other intermediate obliquities be again in fits of easy transmission, and so go out to the Chart, and paint on it the Rings of Colours about the white Spot. And because the intervals of the fits at equal obliquities are greater and fewer in the less refrangible rays, and less and more numerous in the more refrangible, therefore the less refrangible at equal obliquities shall make fewer Rings than the more refrangible, and the Rings made by those shall be larger than the like number of Rings made by these; that is, the red Rings shall be larger than the yellow, the yellow than the green, the green than the blue, and the blue than the violet, as they were really found to be in the 5th Observation. And therefore the first Ring of all Colours incompassing the white Spot of Light shall be red without any violet within, and yellow, and green, and blue in the middle, as it was found in the second Observation; and these Colours in the second Ring, and those that follow shall be more expanded till they spread into one another, and blend one another by interfering.
<99>
These seem to be the reasons of these Rings in general, and this put me upon observing the thickness of the Glass, and considering whether the dimensions and proportions of the Rings may be truly derived from it by computation.
OBS. VIII.
I measured therefore the thickness of this concavo-convex plate of Glass, and found it every-where  of an Inch precisely. Now, by the 6th Observation of the first Part of this Book, a thin plate of Air transmits the brightest Light of the first Ring, that is the bright yellow, when its thickness is the th part of an Inch, and by the 10th Observation of the same part, a thin plate of Glass transmits the same Light of the same Ring when its thickness is less in proportion of the sine of refraction to the sine of incidence, that is, when its thickness is the th or th part of an Inch, supposing the sines are as 11 to 17. And if this thickness be doubled it transmits the same bright Light of the second Ring, if tripled it transmits that of the third, and so on, the bright yellow Light in all these cases being in its fits of transmission. And therefore if its thickness be multiplied 34386 times so as to become  of an Inch it transmits the same bright Light of the 34386th Ring. Suppose this be the bright yellow Light transmitted perpendicularly from the reflecting convex side of the Glass through the concave side to the white Spot in the center of the Rings of Colours on the Chart: And by a rule in the seventh Observation in the first Part of the first Book, and by the 15th and 20th Propositions <100> of the third Part of this Book, if the rays be made oblique to the Glass, the thickness of the Glass requisite to transmit the same bright Light of the same Ring in any obliquity is to this thickness of  of an Inch, as the secant of an Angle whose sine is the first of an hundred and six arithmetical means between the sines of incidence and refraction, counted from the sine of incidence when the refraction is made out of any plated Body into any medium encompassing it, that is, in this case, out of Glass into Air. Now if the thickness of the Glass be increased by degrees,so as to bear to its first thickness, (viz. that of a quarter of an Inch) the proportions which 34386 (the number of fits of the perpendicular rays in going through the Glass towards the white Spot in the center of the Rings,) hath to 34385, 34384, 34383 and 34382 (the numbers of the fits of the oblique rays in going through the Glass towards the first, second, third and fourth Rings of Colours,) and if the first thickness be divided into 100000000 equal parts, the increased thicknesses will be 100002908, 100005816, 100008725 and 100011633, and the Angles of which these thicknesses are secants will be 26′ 13″, 37′ 5″, 45′ 6″ and 52′ 26″, the Radius being 100000000; and the sines of these Angles are 762, 1079, 1321 and 1525, and the proportional sines of refraction 1172, 1659, 2031 and 2345, the Radius being 100000. For since the sines of incidence out of Glass into Air are to the sines of refraction as 11 to 17, and to the above-mentioned secants as 11 to the first of 106 arithmetical means between 11 and 17, that is as 11 to , those secants will be to the sines of refraction as  to 17, and by this Analogy will give these sines. So then <101> if the obliquities of the rays to the concave surface of the Glass be such that the sines of their refraction in passing out of the Glass through that surface into the Air be 1172, 1659, 2031, 2345, the bright Light of the 34386th Ring shall emerge at the thicknesses of the Glass which are to  of an Inch as 34386 to 34385, 34384, 34383, 34382, respectively. And therefore if the thickness in all these cases be  of an Inch (as it is in the Glass of which the Speculum was made) the bright Light of the 34385th Ring shall emerge where the sine of refraction is 1172, and that of the 34384th, 34383th and 34382th Ring where the sine is 1659, 2031, and 2345 respectively. And in these Angles of refraction the Light of these Rings shall be propagated from the Speculum to the Chart, and there paint Rings about the white central round Spot of Light which we said was the Light of the 34386th Ring. And the Semidiameters of these Rings shall subtend the Angles of refraction made at the concave surface of the Speculum, and by consequence their Diameters shall be to the distance of the Chart from the Speculum as those sines of refraction doubled are to the Radius that is as 1172, 1659, 2031, and 2345, doubled are to 100000. And therefore if the distance of the Chart from the concave surface of the Speculum be six Feet (as it was in the third of these Observations) the Diameters of the Rings of this bright yellow Light upon the Chart shall be 1'688, 2'389, 2'925, 3'375 Inches: For these Diameters are to six Feet as the above-mentioned sines doubled are to the Radius. Now these Diameters of the bright yellow Rings, thus found by computation are the very same with those found in the third of these Observations by measuring <102> them, (viz. with {}, , ,and  Inches, and therefore the Theory of deriving these Rings from the thickness of the plate of Glass of which the Speculum was made, and from the obliquity of the emerging rays agrees with the Observation. In this Computation I have equalled the Diameters of the bright Rings made by Light of all Colours, to the Diameters of the Rings made by the bright yellow. For this yellow makes the brightest part of the Rings of all Colours. If you desire the Diameters of the Rings made by the Light of any other unmixed Colour, you may find them readily by putting them to the Diameters of the bright yellow ones in a subduplicate proportion of the intervals of the fits of the rays of those Colours when equally inclined to the refracting or reflecting surface which caused those fits, that is, by putting the Diameters of the Rings made by the rays in the extremities and limits of the seven Colours, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indico, violet, proportional the Cube-roots of the numbers, 1, , , , , , , , which express the lengths of a Monochord sounding the notes in an Eight : For by this means the Diameters of the Rings of these Colours will be found pretty nearly in the same proportion to one another, which they ought to have by the fifth of these Observations.
And thus I satisfyed my self that these Rings were of the same kind and original with those of thin plates, and by consequence that the fits or alternate dispositions of the rays to be reflected and transmitted are propagated to great distances from every reflecting and refracting surface. But yet to put the matter out of doubt I added the following Observation.
<103>
OBS. IX.
If these Rings thus depend on the thickness of the plate of Glass their Diameters at equal distances from several Speculums made of such concavo-convex plates of Glass as are ground on the same Sphere, ought to be reciprocally in a subduplicate proportion of the thicknesses of the plates of Glass. And if this proportion be found true by experience it will amount to a demonstration that these Rings (like those formed in thin plates) do depend on the thickness of the Glass. I procured therefore another concavo-convex plate of Glass ground on both sides to the same Sphere with the former plate. Its thickness was  parts of an Inch; and the Diameters of the three first bright Rings measured between the brightest parts of their orbits at the distance of 6 Feet from the Glass were 3. . . Inches. Now the thickness of the other Glass being  of an Inch was to the thickness of this Glass as  to , that is as 31 to 10, or 310000000 to 100000000, and the roots of these numbers are 17607 and 10000, & in the proportion of the first of these roots to the second are the Diameters of the bright Rings made in this Observation by the thinner Glass, 3. .  to the Diameters of the same Rings made in the third of these Observations by the thicker Glass . . , that is, the Diameters of the Rings are reciprocally in a subduplicate proportion of the thicknesses of the plates of Glass.
So then in plates of Glass which are alike concave on one side, and alike convex on the other side, and alike quick-silvered on the convex sides, and differ in nothing <104> but their thickness, the Diameters of the Rings are reciprocally in a subduplicate proportion of the thicknesses of the plates. And this shews sufficiently that the Rings depend on both the surfaces of the Glass. They depend on the convex surface because they are more luminous when that surface is quick-silvered over than when it is without Quick-silver. They depend also upon the concave surface, because without that surface a Speculum makes them not. They depend on both surfaces and on the distances between them, because their bigness is varied by varying only that distance. And this dependance is of the same kind with that which the Colours of thin plates have on the distance of the surfaces of those plates, because the bigness of the Rings and their proportion to one another, and the variation of their bigness arising from the variation of the thickness of the Glass, and the orders of their Colours, is such as ought to result from the Propositions in the end of the third Part of this Book,derived from the Phænomena of the Colours of thin plates set down in the first Part.
There are yet other Phænomena of these Rings of Colours but such as follow from the same Propositions, and therefore confirm both the truth of those Propositions, and the Analogy between these Rings and the Rings of Colours made by very thin plates. I shall subjoyn some of them.
<105>
OBS. X.
When the beam of the Sun's Light was reflected back from the Speculum not directly to the Hole in the Window, but to a place a little distant from it, the common center of that Spot, and of all the Rings of Colours fell in the middle way between the beam of the incident Light, and the beam of the reflected Light, and by consequence in the center of the spherical concavity of the Speculum, whenever the Chart on which the Rings of Colours fell was placed at that center. And as the beam of reflected Light by inclining the Speculum receded more and more from the beam of incident Light and from the common center of the coloured Rings between them, those Rings grew bigger and bigger, and so also did the white round Spot,and new Rings of Colours emerged successively out of their common center, and the white Spot became a white Ring encompassing them ; and the incident and reflected beams of Light always fell upon the opposite parts of this white Ring, illuminating its perimeter like two mock Suns in the opposite parts of an Iris. So then the Diameter of this Ring, measured from the middle of its Light on one side to the middle of its Light on the other side, was always equal to the distance between the middle of the incident beam of Light, and the middle of the reflected beam measured at the Chart on which the Rings appeared: And the rays which formed this Ring were reflected by the Speculum in Angles equal to their Angles of incidence, and by consequence to their Angles of refraction at their entrance into the Glass, but yet their Angles of <106> reflexion were not in the same planes with their Angles of incidence.
OBS. XI.
The Colours of the new Rings were in a contrary order to those of the former, and arose after this manner. The white round Spot of Light in the middle of the Rings continued white to the center till the distance of the incident and reflected beams at the Chart was about  parts of an Inch, and then it began to grow dark in the middle. And when that distance was about  of an Inch, the white Spot was become a Ring encompassing a dark round Spot which in the middle inclined to violet and indico. And the luminous Rings incompassing it were grown equal to those dark ones which in the four first Observations encompassed them, that is to say, the white Spot was grown a white Ring equal to the first of those dark Rings, and the first of those luminous Rings was now grown equal to the second of those dark ones, and the second of those luminous ones to the third of those dark ones, and so on. For the Diameters of the luminous Rings were now , , , , &c. Inches.
When the distance between the incident and reflected beams of Light became a little bigger, there emerged out of the middle of the dark Spot after the indico a blue, and then out of that blue a pale green, and soon after a yellow and red. And when the Colour at the center was brightest, being between yellow and red, the bright Rings were grown equal to those Rings which in the four first Observations next encompassed them; <107> that is to say, the white Spot in the middle of those Rings was now become a white Ring equal to the first of those bright Rings, and the first of those bright ones was now become equal to the second of those, and so on. For the Diameters of the white Rings, and of the other luminous Rings incompassing it, were now , , , , &c. or thereabouts.
When the distance of the two beams of Light at the Chart was a little more increased, there emerged out of the middle in order after the red, a purple, a blue, a green, a yellow, and a red inclining much to purple, and when the Colour was brightest being between yellow and red, the former indico, blue, green, yellow and red, were become an Iris or Ring of Colours equal to the first of those luminous Rings which appeared in the four first Observations, and the white Ring which was now become the second of the luminous Rings was grown equal to the second of those, and the first of those which was now become the third Ring was become the third of those, and so on. For their Diameters were , , ,  Inches, the distance of the two beams of Light, and the Diameter of the white Ring being  Inches.
When these two beams became more distant there emerged out of the middle of the purplish red, first a darker round Spot, and then out of the middle of that Spot a brighter. And now the former Colours (purple, blue, green, yellow, and purplish red) were become a Ring equal to the first of the bright Rings mentioned in the four first Observations, and the Rings about this Ring were grown equal to the Rings about that respectively ; the distance between the two beams of <108> Light and the Diameter of the white Ring (which was now become the third Ring) being about 3 Inches.
The Colours of the Rings in the middle began now to grow very dilute, and if the distance between the two beams was increased half an Inch, or an Inch more, they vanished whilst the white Ring, with one or two of the Rings next it on either side, continued still visible. But if the distance of the two beams of Light was still more increased these also vanished: For the Light which coming from several parts of the Hole in the Window fell upon the Speculum in several Angles of incidence made Rings of several bignesses, which diluted and blotted out one another, as I knew by intercepting some part of that Light. For if I intercepted that part which was nearest to the Axis of the Speculum the Rings would be less, if the other part which was remotest from it they would be bigger.
OBS. XII.
When the Colours of the Prism were cast successively on the Speculum, that Ring which in the two last Observations was white, was of the same bigness in all the Colours, but the Rings without it were greater in the green than in the blue, and still greater in the yellow, and greatest in the red. And, on the contrary, the Rings within that white Circle were less in the green than in the blue, and still less in the yellow, and least in the red. For the Angles of reflexion of those rays which made this Ring being equal to their Angles of incidence, the fits of every reflected ray within the Glass <109> after reflexion are equal in length and number to the fits of the same ray within the Glass before its incidence on the reflecting surface; and therefore since all the rays of all sorts at their entrance into the Glass were in a fit of transmission, they were also in a fit of transmission at their returning to the same surface after reflexion; and by consequence were transmitted and went out to the white Ring on the Chart. This is the reason why that Ring was of the same bigness in all theColours, and why in a mixture of all it appears white. But in rays which are reflected in other Angles, the intervals of the fits of the least refrangible being greatest, make the Rings of their Colour in their progress from this white Ring, either outwards or inwards, increase or decrease by the greatest steps; so that the Rings of this Colour without are greatest, and within least. And this is the reason why in the last Observation, when the Speculum was illuminated with white Light, the exterior Rings made by all Colours appeared red without and blue within, and the interior blue without and red within.
These are the Phænomena of thick convexo-concave plates of Glass, which are every where of the same thickness. There are yet other Phænomena when these plates are a little thicker on one side than on the other, and others when the plates are more or less concave than convex, or plano-convex, or double-convex. For in all these cases the plates make Rings of Colours, but after various manners; all which, so far as I have yet observed, follow from the Propositions in the end of the third part of this Book, and so conspire to confirm the truth of those Propositions. But the Phæno <110> mena are too various, and the Calculations whereby they follow from those Propositions too intricate to be here prosecuted. I content my self with having prosecuted this kind of Phænomena so far as to discover their cause, and by discovering it to ratify the Propositions in the third Part of this Book.
OBS. XIII.
As Light reflected by a Lens quick-silvered on the back-side makes the Rings of Colours above described, so it ought to make the like Rings of Colours in passing through a drop of Water. At the first reflexion of the rays within the drop, some Colours ought to be transmitted, as in the case of a Lens, and others to be reflected back to the Eye. For instance, if the Diameter of a small drop or globule of Water be about the 500th part of an Inch, so that a red-making ray in passing through the middle of this globule has 250 fits of easy transmission within the globule, and that all the red-making rays which are at a certain distance from this middle ray round about it have 249 fits within the globule, and all the like rays at a certain further distance round about it have 248 fits, and all those at a certain further distance 247 fits, and so on; these concentrick Circles of rays after their transmission, falling on a white Paper, will make concentrick rings of red upon the Paper, supposing the Light which passes through one single globule strong enough to be sensible. And, in like manner, the rays of other Colours will make Rings of other Colours. Suppose now that in a fair day the Sun shines through a thin Cloud of such <111> globules of Water or Hail, and that the globules are all of the same bigness,and the Sun seen through this Cloud shall appear incompassed with the like concentrick Rings of Colours, and the Diameter of the first Ring of red shall be  degrees, that of the second  degrees, that of the third 12 degrees 33 minutes. And accordingly as the globules of Water are bigger or less, the Rings shall be less or bigger. This is the Theory, and experience answers it. For in June 1692. I saw by reflexion in a Vessel of stagnating Water three Halos Crowns or Rings of Colours about the Sun, like three little Rain-bows, concentrick to his Body. The Colours of the first or innermost Crown were blue next the Sun, red without, and white in the middle between the blue and red. Those of the second Crown were purple and blue within, and pale red without, and green in the middle. And those of the third were pale blue within, and pale red without; these Crowns inclosed one another immediately, so that their Colours proceeded in this continual order from the Sun outward: blue, white, red; purple, blue, green, pale yellow and red; pale blue, pale red. The Diameter of the second Crown measured from the middle of the yellow and red on one side of the Sun, to the middle of the same Colour on the other side was  degrees, or thereabouts. The Diameters of the first and third I had not time to measure, but that of the first seemed to be about five or six degrees, and that of the third about twelve. The like Crowns appear sometimes about the Moon; for in the beginning of the Year 1664, Febr. 19th at night, I saw two such Crowns about her. The Diameter of the first or innermost was about three degrees, and that of the <112> second about five degrees and an half. Next about the Moon was a Circle of white, and next about that the inner Crown which was of a bluish green within next the white, and of a yellow and red without, and next about these Colours were blue and green on the inside of the outward Crown, and red on the outside of it. At the same time there appeared a Halo about 22 degrees 35′ distant from the center of the Moon. It was Elliptical, and its long Diameter was perpendicular to the Horizon verging below farthest from the Moon. I am told that the Moon has sometimes three or more concentrick Crowns of Colours incompassing one another next about her Body. The more equal the globules of Water or Ice are to one another, the more Crowns of Colours will appear, and the Colours will be the more lively. The Halo at the distance of  degrees from the Moon is of another sort. By its being oval and remoter from the Moon below than above, I conclude, that it was made by refraction in some sort of Hail or Snow floating in the Air in an horizontal Posture, the refracting Angle being about 58 or 60 degrees.

THE  THIRD BOOK  OF  OPTICKS.
GRimaldo has informed us, that if a beam of the Sun's Light be let into a dark Room through a very small Hole, the shadows of things in this Light will be larger than they ought to be if the rays went on by the Bodies in streight Lines, and that these shadows have three parallel fringes, bands or ranks of coloured Light adjacent to them. But if the Hole be enlarged the fringes grow broad and run into one another, so that they cannot be distinguished. These broad shadows and fringes have been reckoned by some to proceed from the ordinary refraction of the Air, but without due examination of the matter. For the circumstances of the Phænomenon, so far as I have observed them, are as follows.
<114>
OBS. I.
I made in a piece of Lead a small Hole with a Pin, whose breadth was the 42th part of an Inch. For 21 of those Pins laid together took up the breadth of half an Inch. Through this Hole I let into my darkened Chamber a beam of the Sun's Light, and found that the shadows of Hairs, Thred, Pins, Straws, and such like slender substances placed in this beam of Light, were considerably broader than they ought to be, if the rays of Light passed on by these Bodies in right Lines. And particularly a Hair of a Man's Head, whose breadth was but the 280th part of an Inch, being held in this Light, at the distance of about twelve Feet from the Hole, did cast a shadow which at the distance of four Inches from the Hair was the sixtieth part of an Inch broad, that is, above four times broader than the Hair, and at the distance of two Feet from the Hair was about the eight and twentieth part of an Inch broad, that is, ten times broader than the Hair, and at the distance of ten Feet was the eighth part of an Inch broad, that is 35 times broader.
Nor is it material whether the Hair be incompassed with Air, or with any other pellucid substance. For I wetted a polished plate of Glass, and laid the Hair in the Water upon the Glass, and then laying another polished plate of Glass upon it, so that the Water might fill up the space between the Glasses, I held them in the aforesaid beam of Light, so that the Light might pass through them perpendicularly, and the shadow of the Hair was at the same distances as big as before. <115> The shadows of scratches made in polished plates of Glass were also much broader than they ought to be, and the Veins in polished plates of Glass did also cast the like broad shadows. And therefore the great breadth of these shadows proceeds from some other cause than the refraction of the Air.
[Image 1] Let the Circle X represent the middle of the Hair; ADG, BEH, CFI, three rays passing by one side of the Hair at several distances; KNQ, LOR, MPS, three other rays passing by the other side of the Hair at the like distances; D, E, F, and N, 0, P, the places where the rays are bent in their passage by the Hair; G, H, I, and Q, R, S, the places where the rays fall on a Paper GQ; IS the breadth of the shadow of the Hair cast on the Paper, and TI, VS, two rays passing to the points I and S without bending when the Hair is taken away. And it's manifest that all the Light between these two rays AI and VS is bent in passing by the Hair, and turned aside from the shadow IS, because if any part of this Light were not bent it would fall on the Paper within the shadow, and there illuminate the Paper contrary to experience. And because when the Paper is at a great distance from the Hair, the shadow is broad, and therefore the rays TI and VS are at a great distance from one another, it follows that the Hair acts upon the rays of Light at a good distance in their passing by it. But the action is strongest on the rays which pass by at least distances, and grows weaker and weaker accordingly as the rays pass by at distances greater and greater, as is represented in the Scheme: For thence it comes to pass, that the shadow of the Hair is much broader in proportion to the distance of <116> the Paper from the Hair, when the Paper is nearer the Hair than when it is at a great distance from it.
OBS. II.
The shadows of all Bodies (Metals, Stones, Glass, Wood, Horn, Ice, &c.) in this Light were bordered with three parallel fringes or bands of coloured Light, whereof that which was contiguous to the shadow was broadest and most luminous, and that which was remotest from it was narrowest, and so faint, as not easily to be visible. It was difficult to distinguish the Colours unless when the Light fell very obliquely upon a smooth Paper, or some other smooth white Body, so as to make them appear much broader than they would otherwise do. And then the Colours were plainly visible in this order: The first or innermost fringe was violet and deep blue next the shadow, and then light blue, green, and yellow in the middle, and red without. The second fringe was almost contiguous to the first, and the third to the second, and both were blue within, and yellow and red without, but their Colours were very faint especially those of the third. The Colours therefore proceeded in this order from the shadow, violet, indico, pale blue, green, yellow, red; blue, yellow, red; pale blue, pale yellow and red. The shadows made by scratches and bubbles in polished plates of Glass were bordered with the like fringes of coloured Light. And if plates of Looking-glass sloop'd off near the edges with a Diamond-cut, be held in the same beam of Light, the Light which passes through the parallel planes of the Glass will be bordered with the like fringes of Co <117> lours where those Planes meet with the Diamond cut, and by this means there will sometimes appear four or five fringes of Colours.[Image 2] Let AB, CD represent the parallel planes of a Looking-glass, and BD the plane of the Diamond-cut, making at B a very obtuse Angle with the plane AB. And let all the Light between the rays ENI and FBM pass directly through the parallel planes of the Glass, and fall upon the Paper between I and M, and all the Light between the rays GO and HD be refracted by the oblique plane of the Diamond cut BD, and fall upon the Paper between K and L; and the Light which passes directly through the parallel planes of the Glass, and falls upon the Paper between I and M, will be bordered with three or more fringes at M.
OBS. III.
When the Hair was twelve Feet distant from the Hole, and its shadow fell obliquely upon a flat white scale of Inches and parts of an Inch placed half a Foot beyond it, and also when the shadow fell perpendicularly upon the same scale placed nine Feet beyond it; I measured the breadth of the shadow and fringes as accurately as I could, and found them in parts of an Inch as follows.
<118>
At the Distance of
half a Foot.
Nine Feet.
The breadth of the Shadow


The breadth between the middles of the brightest Light of the innermost fringes on either side the shadow
 or 

The breadth between the middles of the brightest Light of the middlemost fringes on either side the shadow


The breadth between the middles of the brightest Light of the outmost fringes on either side the shadow
 or 

The distance between the middles of the brightest Light of the first and second fringes


The distance between the middles of the brightest Light of the second and third fringes


The breadth of the luminous part (green, white, yellow, and red) of the first fringe


The breadth of the darker space between the first and second fringes.


The breadth of the luminous part of the second fringe


The breadth of the darker space between the second and third fringes.


<119>
These Measures I took by letting the shadow of the Hair at half a Foot distance fall so obliquely on the scale as to appear twelve times broader than when it fell perpendicularly on it at the same distance, and setting down in this Table the twelfth part of the measures I then took.
OBS. IV.
When the shadow and fringes were cast obliquely upon a smooth white Body, and that Body was removed further and further from the Hair, the first fringe began to appear and look brighter than the rest of the Light at the distance of less than a quarter of an Inch from the Hair, and the dark line or shadow between that and the second fringe began to appear at a less distance from the Hair than that of the third part of an Inch. The second fringe began to appear at a distance from the Hair of less than half an Inch, and the shadow between that and the third fringe at a distance less than an Inch, and the third fringe at a distance less than three Inches. At greater distances they became much more sensible, but kept very nearly the same proportion of their breadths and intervals which they had at their first appearing. For the distance between the middle of the first and middle of the second fringe, was to the distance between the middle of the second and middle of the third fringe, as three to two, or ten to seven. And the last of these two distances was equal to the breadth of the bright Light or luminous part of the first fringe. And this breadth was to the breadth of the bright Light of the second fringe as seven to four, and to the dark <120> interval of the first and second fringe as three to two, and to the like dark interval between the second and third as two to one. For the breadths of the fringes seemed to be in the progression of the numbers 1, ,  and their intervals to be in the same progression with them; that is, the fringes and their intervals together to be in the continual progression of the numbers 1, ,,,, or thereabouts. And these proportions held the same very nearly at all distances from the Hair; the dark Intervals of the fringes being as broad in proportion to the fringes at their first appearance as afterwards at great distances from the Hair, though not so dark and distinct.
OBS. V.
The Sun shining into my darkened Chamber through a Hole a quarter of an Inch broad; I placed at the distance of two or three Feet from the Hole a Sheet of Past-board, which was black'd all over on both sides, and in the middle of it had a Hole about three quarters of an Inch square for the Light to pass through. And behind the Hole I fastened to the Past-board with Pitch the blade of a sharp Knife, to intercept some part of the Light which passed through the Hole. The planes of the Past-board and blade of the Knife were parallel to one another, and perpendicular to the rays. And when they were so placed that none of the Sun's Light fell on the Past-board, but all of it passed through the Hole to the Knife, and there part of it fell upon the blade of the Knife, and part of it passed by its edge: I let this part of the Light which passed by, fall on a <121> white Paper two or three Feet beyond the Knife, and there saw two streams of faint Light shoot out both ways from the beam of Light into the shadow like the tails of Comets. But because the Sun's direct Light by its brightness upon the Paper obscured these faint streams, so that I could scarce see them, I made a little Hole in the midst of the Paper for that Light to pass through and fall on a black cloth behind it; and then I saw the two streams plainly. They were like one another, and pretty nearly equal in length and breadth, and quantity of Light. Their Light at that end next the Sun's direct Light was pretty strong for the space of about a quarter of an Inch, or half an Inch, and in all its progress from that direct Light decreased gradually till it became insensible. The whole length of either of these streams measured upon the Paper at the distance of three Feet from the Knife was about six or eight Inches; so that it subtended an Angle at the edge of the Knife of about 10 or 12, or at most 14 degrees. Yet sometimes I thought I saw it shoot three or four degrees further, but with a Light so very faint that I could scarce perceive it, and suspected it might (in some measure at least) arise from some other cause than the two streams did. For placing my Eye in that Light beyond the end of that stream which was behind the Knife, and looking towards the Knife, I could see a line of Light upon its edge, and that not only when my Eye was in the line of the streams, but also when it was without that line either towards the point of the Knife, or towards the handle. This line of Light appeared contiguous to the edge of the Knife, and was narrower than the Light of the innermost fringe, and <122> narrowest when my Eye was furthest from the direct Light, and therefore seemed to pass between the Light of that fringe and the edge of the Knife, and that which passed nearest the edge to be most bent, though not all of it.
OBS. VI.
I placed another Knife by this so that their edges might be parallel and look towards one another, and that the beam of Light might fall upon both the Knives, and some part of it pass between their edges. And when the distance of their edges was about the 400th part of an Inch the stream parted in the middle, and left a shadow between the two parts. This shadow was so black and dark that all the Light which passed between the Knives seemed to be bent, and turned aside to the one hand or to the other. And as the Knives still approached one another the shadow grew broader, and the streams shorter at their inward ends which were next the shadow, until upon the contact of the Knives the whole Light vanished leaving its place to the shadow.
And hence I gather that the Light which is least bent, and goes to the inward ends of the streams, passes by the edges of the Knives at the greatest distance, and this distance when the shadow begins to appear between the streams is about the eight-hundredth part of an Inch. And the Light which passes by the edges of the Knives at distances still less and less is more and more bent, and goes to those parts of the streams which are further and further from the direct Light, because <123> when the Knives approach one another till they touch, those parts of the streams vanish last which are furthest from the direct Light.
OBS. VII.
In the fifth Observation the fringes did not appear, but by reason of the breadth of the Hole in the Window became so broad as to run into one another, and by joyning make one continued Light in the beginning of the streams. But in the sixth, as the Knives approached one another, a little before the shadow appeared between the two streams, the fringes began to appear on the inner ends of the streams on either side of the direct Light, three on one side made by the edge of one Knife, and three on the other side made by the edge of the other Knife. They were distinctest when the Knives were placed at the greatest distance from the Hole in the Window, and still became more distinct by making the Hole less, insomuch that I could sometimes see a faint lineament of a fourth fringe beyond the three above-mentioned. And as the Knives continually approached one another, the fringes grew distincter and larger until they vanished. The outmost fringe vanished first, and the middlemost next, and the innermost last. And after they were all vanished, and the line of Light which was in the middle between them was grown very broad, enlarging it self on both sides into the streams of Light described in the fifth Observation, the above-mentioned shadow began to appear in the middle of this line, and divide it along the middle into two lines of Light, and increased until the whole <124> Light vanished. This inlargement of the fringes was so great that the rays which go to the innermost fringe seemed to be bent above twenty times more when this fringe was ready to vanish, than when one of the Knives was taken away.
And from this and the former Observation compared, I gather, that the Light of the first fringe passed by the edge of the Knife at a distance greater than the eight-hundredth part of an Inch, and the Light of the second fringe passed by the edge of the Knife at a greater distance than the Light of the first fringe did, and that of the third at a greater distance than that of the second, and that of the streams of Light described in the fifth and sixth Observations passed by the edges of the Knives at less distances than that of any of the fringes.
OBS. VIII.
I caused the edges of two Knives to be ground truly streight, and pricking their points into a board so that their edges might look towards one another, and meeting near their points contain a rectilinear Angle, I fastned their handles together with Pitch to make this Angle invariable. The distance of the edges of the Knives from one another at the distance of four Inches from the angular point, where the edges of the Knives met, was the eighth part of an Inch, and therefore the Angle contained by the edges was about 1 degr. 54'. The Knives thus fixed together I placed in a beam of the Sun's Light, let into my darkened Chamber through a Hole the 42th part of an Inch wide, at the distance <125> of ten or fifteen Feet from the Hole, and let the Light which passed between their edges fall very obliquely upon a smooth white Ruler at the distance of half an Inch, or an Inch from the Knives, and there saw the fringes made by the two edges of the Knives run along the edges of the shadows of the Knives in Lines parallel to those edges without growing sensibly broader, till they met in Angles equal to the Angle contained by the edges of the Knives, and where they met and joyned they ended without crossing one another. But if the Ruler was held at a much greater distance from the Paper, the fringes became something broader and broader as they approached one another, and after they met they crossed one another,and then became much broader than before.
Whence I gather that the distances at which the fringes pass by the Knives are not increased nor altered by the approach of the Knives, but the Angles in which the rays are there bent are much increased by that approach; and that the Knife which is nearest any ray determines which way the ray shall be bent, and the other Knife increases the bent.
OBS. IX.
When the rays fell very obliquely upon the Ruler at the distance of the third part of an Inch from the Knives, the dark line between the first and second fringe of the shadow of one Knife, and the dark line between the first and second fringe of the shadow of the other Knife met with one another, at the distance of the fifth part of an Inch from the end of the Light which passed be <126> tween the Knives at the concourse of their edges. And therefore the distance of the edges of the Knives at the meeting of these dark lines was the 160th part of an Inch. For as four Inches to the eighth part of an Inch, so is any length of the edges of the Knives measured from the point of their concourse to the distance of the edges of the Knives at the end of that length, and so is the fifth part of an Inch to the 160th part. So then the dark lines above-mentioned meet in the middle of the Light which passes between the Knives where they are distant the 160th part of an Inch, and the one half of that Light passes by the edge of one Knife at a distance not greater than the 320th part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the fringes of the shadow of that Knife, and the other half passes by the edge of the other Knife, at a distance not greater than the 320th part of an Inch, and falling upon the Paper makes the fringes of the shadow of the other Knife. But if the Paper be held at a distance from the Knives greater than the third part of an Inch, the dark lines above-mentioned meet at a greater distance than the fifth part of an Inch from the end of the Light which passed between the Knives at the concourse of their edges; and therefore the Light which falls upon the Paper where those dark lines meet passes between the Knives where their edges are distant above the 160th part of an Inch.
For at another time when the two Knives were distant eight Feet and five Inches from the little Hole in the Window, made with a small Pin as above, the Light which fell upon the Paper where the aforesaid dark lines met, passed between the Knives, where the di <127> stance between their edges was as in the following Table, when the distance of the Paper from the Knives was also as follows.

And hence I gather that the Light which makes the fringes upon the Paper is not the same Light at all distances of the Paper from the Knives, but when the Paper is held near the Knives, the fringes are made by Light which passes by the edges of the Knives at a less distance, and is more bent than when the Paper is held at a greater distance from the Knives.
OBS. X.
When the fringes of the shadows of the Knives fell perpendicularly upon a Paper at a great distance from the Knives, they were in the form of Hyperbolas, and their dimensions were as follows. Let CA, CB represent lines drawn upon the Paper parallel to the edges of the Knives, and between which all the Light would fall, if it passed between the edges of the Knives without inflexion; DE a right line drawn through C making <128> the Angles ACD, BCE, equal to one another, and terminating all the Light which falls upon the Paper from the point where the edges of the Knives meet; eis, fkt, and glv, three hyperbolical lines representing the terminus of the shadow of one of the Knives, the dark line between the first and second fringes of that shadow, and the dark line between the second and third fringes of the same shadow; xip, ykq and zlr, three other Hyperbolical lines representing the terminus of the shadow of the other Knife, the dark line between the first and second fringes of that shadow, and the dark line between the second and third fringes of the same shadow. And conceive that these three Hyperbolas are like and equal to the former three, and cross them in the points i, k, and l, and that the shadows of the Knives are terminated and distinguished from the first luminous fringes by the lines eis and xip, until the meeting and crossing of the fringes, and then those lines cross the fringes in the form of dark lines, terminating the first luminous fringes within side, and distinguishing them from another Light which begins to appear at i, and illuminates all the triangular space ipDEs comprehended by these dark lines, and the right line DE. Of these Hyperbolas one Asymptote is the line DE, and their other Asymptotes are parallel to the lines CA and CB. Let rv represent a line drawn any where upon the Paper parallel to the Asymptote DE, and let this line cross the right lines AC in m and BC in n, and the six dark hyperbolical lines in p, q, r; s, t, v; and by measuring the distances ps, qt, rv, and thence collecting the lengths of the ordinates np, nq, nr or ms, mt, mv, and doing this at several distances of the line rv, <129> from the Asymptote DE you may find as many points of these Hyperbolas as you please, and thereby know that these curve lines are Hyperbolas differing little from the conical Hyperbola. And by measuring the lines Ci, Ck, Cl, you may find other points of these Curves.
For instance, when the Knives were distant from the Hole in the Window ten Feet, and the Paper from the Knives 9 Feet, and the Angle contained by the edges of the Knives to which the Angle ACB is equal, was subtended by a chord which was to the Radius as 1 to 32, and the distance of the line rv from the Asymptote DE was half an Inch: I measured the lines ps, qt, rv, and found them 0'35, 0'65, 0'98 Inches respectively, and by adding to their halfs the line  mn (which here was the 128th part of an Inch, or 0'0078 Inches) the sums np, nq, nr, were 0'1828, 0'3328, 0'4978 Inches. I measured also the distances of the brightest parts of the fringes which run between pq and st, qr and tv, and next beyond r and v, and found them 0'5, 0'8, and 1'17 Inches.
OBS. XI.
The Sun shining into my darkened Room through a small round Hole made in a plate of Lead with a slender Pin as above; I placed at the Hole a Prism to refract the Light, and form on the opposite Wall the Spectrum of Colours, described in the third Experiment of the first Book. And then I found that the Shadows of all Bodies held in the coloured Light between the Prism and the Wall, were bordered with fringes of the Colour <130> of that Light in which they were held. In the full red Light they were totally red without any sensible blue or violet, and in the deep blue Light they were totally blue without any sensible red or yellow; and so in the green Light they were totally green, excepting a little yellow and blue, which were mixed in the green Light of the Prism. And comparing the Fringes made in the several coloured Lights, I found that those made in the red Light were largest, those made in the violet were least, and those made in the green were of a middle bigness. For the fringes with which the Shadow of a Man's Hair were bordered, being measured cross the shadow at the distance of six Inches from the Hair; the distance between the middle and most luminous part of the first or innermost fringe on one side of the shadow, and that of the like fringe on the other side of the shadow, was in the full red Light  of an Inch, and in the full violet . And the like distance between the middle and most luminous parts of the second fringes on either side the shadow was in the full red Light , and in the violet  of an Inch. And these distances of the fringes held the same proportion at all distances from the Hair without any sensible variation.
So then the rays which made these fringes in the red Light passed by the Hair at a greater distance than those did which made the like fringes in the violet; and therefore the Hair in causing these fringes acted alike upon the red Light or least refrangible rays at a greater distance, and upon the violet or most refrangible rays at a less distance, and by those actions disposed the red Light into larger fringes, and the violet into smaller, and the Lights of intermediate Colours into fringes of <131> intermediate bignesses without changing the Colour of any sort of Light.
When therefore the Hair in the first and second of these Observations was held in the white beam of the Sun's Light, and cast a shadow which was bordered with three fringes of coloured Light, those Colours arose not from any new modifications imprest upon the rays of Light by the Hair, but only from the various inflections whereby the several sorts of rays were separated from one another, which before separation by the mixture of all their Colours, composed the white beam of the Sun's Light, but whenever separated compose Lights of the several Colours which they are originally disposed to exhibit. In this 13th Observation, where the Colours are separated before the Light passes by the Hair, the least refrangible rays, which when separated from the rest make red, were inflected at a greater distance from the Hair, so as to make three red fringes at a greater distance from the middle of the shadow of the Hair; and the most refrangible rays which when separated make violet, were inflected at a less distance from the Hair, so as to make three violet fringes at a less distance from the middle of the shadow of the Hair. And other rays of intermediate degrees of refrangibility were inflected at intermediate distances from the Hair, so as to make fringes of intermediate Colours at intermediate distances from the middle of the shadow of the Hair. And in the second Observation, where all the Colours are mixed in the white Light which passes by the Hair, these Colours are separated by the various inflexions of the rays, and the fringes which they make appear all together, and the innermost <132> fringes being contiguous make one broad fringe composed of all the Colours in due order, the violet lying on the inside of the fringe next the shadow, the red on the outside furthest from the shadow, and the blue, green and yellow, in the middle. And, in like manner, the middlemost fringes of all the Colours lying in order, and being contiguous, make another broad fringe composed of all the Colours; and the outmost fringes of all the Colours lying in order, and being contiguous, make a third broad fringe composed of all the Colours. These are the three fringes of coloured Light with which the Shadows of all Bodies are bordered in the second Observation.
When I made the foregoing Observations, I designed to repeat most of them with more care and exactness, and to make some new ones for determining the manner how the rays of Light are bent in their passage by Bodies for making the fringes of Colours with the dark lines between them. But I was then interrupted, and cannot now think of taking these things into further consideration. And since I have not finished this part of my Design, I shall conclude, with proposing only some Queries in order to a further search to be made by others.
Query 1. Do not Bodies act upon Light at a distance, and by their action bend its rays, and is not this action (cæteris paribus) strongest at the least distance?
Qu. 2. Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility differ also in flexibity, and are they not by their different inflexions separated from one another, so as after separation to make the Colours in the three fringes <133> above described? And after what manner are they inflected to make those fringes?
Qu. 3. Are not the rays of Light in passing by the edges and sides of Bodies, bent several times backwards and forwards, with a motion like that of an Eel? And do not the three fringes of coloured Light above-mentioned, arise from three such bendings?
Qu. 4. Do not the rays of Light which fall upon Bodies, and are reflected or refracted, begin to bend before they arrive at the Bodies; and are they not reflected, refracted and inflected by one and the same Principle, acting variously in various circumstances?
Qu. 5. Do not Bodies and Light act mutually upon one another, that is to say, Bodies upon Light in emitting, reflecting, refracting and inflecting it, and Light upon Bodies for heating them, and putting their parts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists?
Qu. 6. Do not black Bodies conceive heat more easily from Light than those of other Colours do, by reason that the Light falling on them is not reflected outwards, but enters the Bodies, and is often reflected and refracted within them, until it be stifled and lost?
Qu. 7. Is not the strength and vigor of the action between Light and sulphureous Bodies observed above, one reason why sulphureous Bodies take fire more readily, and burn more vehemently, then other Bodies do?
Qu. 8. Do not all fixt Bodies when heated beyond a certain degree, emit Light and shine; and is not this emission performed by the vibrating motions of their parts?
<134>
Qu. 9. Is not fire a Body heated so hot as to emit Light copiously? For what else is a red hot Iron than fire? And what else is a burning Coal than red hot Wood?
Qu. 10. Is not flame a vapour, fume or exhalation heated red hot, that is, so hot as to shine? For Bodies do not flame without emitting a copious fume, and this fume burns in the flame. The Ignis Fatuus is a vapour shining without heat, and is there not the same difference between this vapour and flame, as between rotten Wood shining without heat and burning Coals of fire? In distilling hot Spirits, if the head of the still be taken off, the vapour which ascends out of the Still will take fire at the flame of a Candle, and turn into flame, and the flame will run along the vapour from the Candle to the Still. Some Bodies heated by motion, or fermentation, if the heat grow intense fume copiously, and if the heat be great enough the fumes will shine and become flame. Metals in fusion do not flame for want of a copious fume, except Spelter which fumes copiously, and thereby flames. All flaming Bodies, as Oyl, Tallow, Wax, Wood, fossil Coals, Pitch, Sulphur, by flaming waste and vanish into burning smoke, which smoke, if the flame be put out, is very thick and visible, and sometimes smells strongly, but in the flame loses its smell by burning, and according to the nature of the smoke the flame is of several Colours, as that of Sulphur blue, that of Copper opened with Sublimate green, that of Tallow yellow. Smoke passing through flame cannot but grow red hot, and red hot smoke can have no other appearance than that of flame.

Qu. 11. Do not great Bodies conserve their heat the longest, their parts heating one another, and may not great dense and fix'd Bodies, when heated beyond a certain degree, emit Light so copiously, as by the emission and reaction of its Light, and the reflexions and refractions of its rays within its pores to grow still hotter, till it comes to a certain period of heat, such as is that of the Sun? And are not the Sun and fix'd Stars great Earths vehemently hot, whose heat is conserved by the greatness of the Bodies, and the mutual action and reaction between them, and the Light which they emit, and whose parts are kept from fuming away, not only by their fixity, but also by the vast weight and density of the Atmospheres incumbent upon them, and very strongly compressing them, and condensing the vapours and exhalations which arise from them?
Qu. 12. Do not the rays of Light in falling upon the bottom of the Eye excite vibrations in the Tunica retina? Which vibrations, being propagated along the solid fibres of the optick Nerves into the Brain, cause the sense of seeing. For because dense Bodies conserve their heat a long time, and the densest Bodies conserve their heat the longest, the vibrations of their parts are of a lasting nature, and therefore may be propagated along solid fibres of uniform dense matter to a great distance, for conveying into the Brain the impressions made upon all the Organs of sense. For that motion which can continue long in one and the same part of a Body, can be propagated a long way from one part to another, supposing the Body homogeneal, so that the motion may not be reflected, refracted, interrupted or disordered by any unevenness of the Body.
<136>
Qu.13. Do not several sort of rays make Vibrations of several bignesses, which according to their bignesses excite sensations of several Colours, much after the manner that the vibrations of the Air, according to their several bignesses excite sensations of several sounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible the largest for making a sensation of deep red, and the several intermediate sorts of rays, vibrations of several intermediate bignesses to make sensations of the several intermediate Colours?
Qu.14. May not the harmony and discord of Colours arise from the proportions of the vibrations propagated through the fibres of the optick Nerves into the Brain, as the harmony and discord of sounds arise from the proportions of the vibrations of the Air? For some Colours are agreeable, as those of Gold and Indico, and others disagree.
Qu. 15. Are not the Species of Objects seen with both Eyes united where the optick Nerves meet before they come into the Brain, the fibres on the right side of both Nerves uniting there, and after union going thence into the Brain in the Nerve which is on the right side of the Head, and the fibres on the left side of both Nerves uniting in the same place, and after union going into the Brain in the Nerve which is on the left side of the Head, and these two Nerves meeting in the Brain in such a manner that their fibres make but one entire Species or Picture, half of which on the right side of the Sensorium comes from the right side of both Eyes through the right side of <137> both optick Nerves to the place where the Nerves meet, and from thence on the right side of the Head into the Brain, and the other half on the left side of the Sensorium comes in like manner from the left side of both Eyes. For the optick Nerves of such Animals as look the same way with both Eyes (as of Men, Dogs, Sheep, Oxen, &c.) meet before they come into the Brain, but the optick Nerves of such Animals as do not look the same way with both Eyes (as of Fishes and of the Chameleon) do not meet, if I am rightly informed.
Qu. 16. When a Man in the dark presses either corner of his Eye with his Finger, and turns his Eye away from his Finger, he will see a Circle of Colours like those in the Feather of a Peacock's Tail. Do not these Colours arise from such motions excited in the bottom of the Eye by the pressure of the Finger, as at other times are excited there by Light for causing Vision? And when a Man by a stroke upon his Eye sees a Flash of Light, are not the like Motions excited in the Retina by the stroke?

Draft Versions of 'The Queries'
When I made the foregoing Observations, I designed to repeat most of them with more care & exactness, & to make some new ones for determining the manner how the rays of light are bent in their passage by bodies, for making the fringes of colours with the dark lines between them. But I was then interrupted, & cannot now think of taking these things into further consideration. And since I have not finished this part of my designe, I shall conclude, with proposing only some Quæres in order to a further search to be made by others.
Quære 1. Do not Bodies act upon light at a distance & by their action bend its rays & is not this action (cæteris paribus) strongest at the least distance?
Qu. 2. Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility differ also in flexibility & are they not by their different inflexions separated from one another so as after separation to make the colours in the three fringes [above described? And after what manner are they inflected to make those fringes?
Qu. 3. Are not the rays of Light in passing by the edges & sides of bodies bent several times backwards & forwards with a motion like that of an Eele? And do not the three fringes of coloured light above mentioned arise from three such bendings?
Qu. 4. Do not the rays of Light which fall upon bodies & are reflected or refracted, begin to bend before they arrive at the bodies; & are they not reflected refracted & inflected by one & the same Principle acting variously in various circumstances?
Qu. 5. Do not Bodies & Light act mutually upon one another, that is to say, Bodies upon Light in emitting, reflecting, refracting & inflecting it, and Light upon bodies for heating them & putting their parts into a <232r> vibrating motion wherein heat consists?
Qu. 6. Do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those of other colours do, by reason that the light falling on them is not reflected outwards but enters the bodies & is often reflected & refracted within them untill it be stifled & lost?
Qu. 7. Is not the strength & vigor of the action between Light & sulphureous Bodies observed above, one reason why sulphureous bodies take fire more readily & burn more vehemently then other Bodies do?
Qu. 8. Do not all fixt bodies when heated beyond a certain degree, emit light & shine, & is not this emission performed by the vibrating motions of their parts?
[Qu. 9. Is not fire a body heated so hot as to emit Light copiously? For what else is a red hot Iron then fire, & what else is a burning coale then red hot wood?
Qu. 10. Is not flame a vapour, fume or exhalation heated red hot, that is so hot as to shine? For Bodies do not flame without emitting a copious fume, & this fume burns in the flame. ✝ The Ignis fatuus – < insertion from f 231v > ✝ The Ignis fatuus is a vapour shining without heat, & is there not the same difference between this vapour & flame as between rotten wood shining without heat & burning coales of fire? In destilling hot spirits if the head of the still be taken off the vapour which ascends out of the still will take fire at the flame of a candle & turn into flame & the flame will run along the vapor from the candle to the Still. Some Bodies heated by motion or fermentation if the heat grow intense fume copiously, & if the heat be great enough the fume will shine & become flame. Metals in fusion do not flame for want of a copious fume except Spelter which fumes copiously & thereby flames. All flaming bodies as oyle, tallow, wax, wood, fossil coales, pitch, sulphur, by flaming wast & vanish into burning smoke, which smoke if the flame be put out is very thick & visible & sometimes smells strongly but in the flame loses its smell by burning, & according to the nature of the smoke the flame is of several colours, as that of sulphur blue, that of Copper opened with Sublimate green, that of tallow yellow. Smoke passing through flame cannot but grow red hot & red hot smoke can have no other appearance then that of flame.
Qu. 11. Do not great bodies conserve their heat the longest their parts heating one another, & May not great dense & fixt bodies when heated beyond a certain degree emit light so copiously as by the emission & reaction of its light & the reflexions & refractions of it's rays within its pores to grow still hotter till it comes to a certain period of heat, such as is that of the Sun. And are not the Sun & Fixt Stars great Earths vehemently hot, whose heat — — — < text from f 232r resumes > is conserved by the greatness of the bodies and the mutual action & reaction between them & the Light which they emit, & whose parts are kept from fuming away not only by their fixity but also by the vast weight & density of the Atmospheres incumbent upon them & very strongly compressing them & condensing the vapours & exhalations which arise from them.
Qu. 12. Do not the rays of light in falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the Tunica Retina? which vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the Optic nerves into the Brain cause the sense of seeing? For because dense bodies conserve their heat a long time & the densest bodies conserve their heat the longest, the vibrations of their parts are of a lasting nature & therefore may be propagated along solid fibres of uniform dense matter to a great distance for conveying into the brain the impressions made upon all the Organs of sense. For that motion which can continue long in one & the same part of a body can be propagated a long <233r> way from one part to another, supposing the Body homogeneal so that the motion may not be reflected, refracted interrupted or disordered by any uneavenness of the body.
[Qu. 13. Do not several sorts of rays make vibrations of several bignesses which according to their bignesses excite sensations of several colours much after the manner that the vibrations of the air according to their several bignesses excite sensations of several sounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible the largest for making a sensation of deep red, & the several intermediate sorts of rays, vibrations of several intermediate bignesses to make sensations of the several intermediate colours?
Qu. 14. May not the harmony & discord of colours arise from the proportions of the vibrations propagated through the fibres of the Optick nerves into the brain, as the harmony & discord of sounds arises from the proportions of the vibrations of the Air. For some colours are agreable as those of Gold & Indigo, & others disagree.
Qu. 15. Are not the species of Objects seen with both eyes united where the Optick nerves meet before they come into the brain, the fibres on the right side of both Nerves uniting there & after union going thence into the brain in the Nerve which is on the right side of the head & the fibres on the left side of both Nerves uniting in the same place & after union going into the brain in the Nerve which is on the left side of the head & these two Nerves meeting in the brain in such a manner that their fibres make but one entire species or picture, half of which on the right side of the sensorium comes from the right side of both eyes through the right side of [both Optick Nerves to the place where the Nerves meet & from thence on the right side of the head into the brain, & the other half on the left side of the sensorium comes in like manner from the left side of both eyes. For the Optick Nerves of such animals as look the same way with both eyes (as of Men, Dogs, Sheep, Oxen &c.)

Qu.16. Is not the free passage of light through pellucid bodies an argument that all bodies are very porous. Water is nineteen times lighter in specie then Gold & therefore since the matter in bodies is proportional to their gravity water would have eighteen times more pores then parts of gold were perfectly solid or void of all pores. But gold is also very porous as appears by the soaking of quicksilver into it & by the squeezing of water through it & principally by the passage of light through its particles when foliated or dissolved in Aqua regia. Were the pores of gold but equal to its parts the pores of rain water would contain 37 times more space then its parts. And he that shall invent a rational Hypothesis for explaining how water can be so porous & yet be uncapable of compression by force, may doubtless by the same Hypothesis explain how gold may be as porous as he pleases & all other bodies as much more porous then gold as they are lighter in specie. Suppose a body were composed of parts lying together with as much pores between them, & that these parts were composed of smaller parts lying together with as much pores between them & that these parts were composed of parts still smaller with as much pores between them & so on for as many compositions as you please untill you come at solid parts void of all pores. And if in this progression there were ten compositions, the body would have above a thousand times more pores then parts; if twenty compositions, it would have above a thousand thousand times more pores then parts; if thirty compositions, it would have above a thousand thousand thousand times more pores then parts & so on perpetually. But whatever be the texture of bodies, they must be so porous as in all positions to give passage to the rays of light in right lines through their pores. For whatever the rays of light be whether they consist in the vibrations of a medium, or be bodies trajected, if in passing through the pores of pellucid bodies they do not find room enough to go on in right lines whenever they are once disturbed & turned out of their direct courses, they will go on in their new courses till they are disturbed again, & the more they are disturbed the more they will err & return no more to their first courses unless by very great accident. To suppose that as often as the rays of light are turned out of their way by some parts of the bodies, they will be turned into way again by others is as precarious & extravagant as to suppose that the suns light can pass through a heap of sand & after many reflexions emerge in the same right lines in which it came from the sun, the sands being so disposed that some reflexions shall turn the rays into their right course as often as others turn them out of their way. The great porousness & admirable structure of bodies is further argued from the lastingness of the vibrating motions of their parts wherein heat consists, For without great porousness the parts of bodies could no more vibrate then a spring can tremble in the middst of a heap of sand. And it may be further argued from the great capacity of by corruption & generation to put off & put on all manner of forms, & be changed into all sorts of shapes. The contrivance of the bodies of living creatures is admirable. Not a member but has its use & is mighty well fitted for that use. And can we beleive that he who contrived the bodies of animals with so much artifice was not as skilful & curious in contriving the texture of matter for those ends for which it is fitted. For the forms & uses of matter are innumerable & therefore <234v> we are not to consider it as composed of irregular particles casually laid together like stones in a heap, but as formed wisely for all those uses. One use of matter is to admit menstruums easily into its pores in order to new mixtures & actions by fermentation putrefaction corruption & generation, another to conceive heat easily & keep it long for promoting changes by putrefaction & generation, a those to transmit refract & reflect light for producing all the colours of bodies where in the beauty of nature chiefly consists. Without these uses the earth would have been a dead lump void of heat & motion & alteration & variety of colours: & therefore it is reasonable to allow that he who contrived all things with wisdome, framed matter in such a manner as to fit it best for these uses, & by consequence made it very porous.
Qu. 17 Is there not something diffused through all space in & through which bodies move without resistance & by means of which they act upon one another at a distance in harmonical proportions of their distances.
Qu. 8. — — — And do not all bodies which abound with sulphureous or terrestrial parts emit light whenever those parts are sufficiently agitated by heat attrition percussion putrefaction or any other cause ? 1 So the waves of the salt water of the sea in a storm by dashing against one another emit light, 5 the shavings of steel being scraped of by a stroke with a flint grow hot & melt by the action & shine like sparks of fire . 3 The back of a Cat being struck obliquely with ones hand emits a faint light in a dark room. 6 Iron may be hammered till it grows red hot 7 The wheel of a cart or chariot by vehement attrition sometimes heats the axes so to great a degree as to set it on flame 7 Moist stacks of hay or corn by fermentation & putrefaction grow hot till they emit a shining flame. 2 Quicksilver by any vehement agitation in vacuo shines with a faint light & so does rotting wood & rotting flesh or fish tho all the parts of the body be not agitatted so vehemently as to make the body sensibly warm. And so do the putrid vapours called Ignes fatui 4 One sort of Phosphorus being placed some time in the Suns light conceives an agitation by which it shines for some after in the dark: another sort by the access of fresh air is easily put into motion emits a copious fume with a sulphureous smell & shines & by rubbing it grows hot & takes flame. Some liquors by mixing with one another grow hot & some grow so hot as to emit a shining vapour or flame.
sed quo ipsœ nos latent, et ex hoc nomine quaetatibus specificis causes Phænomenon nondum patentibus imposito deterremar a causis hisce indagandis, quasi quidem illæ penitus essent deploratæ postquam magnus ipse Philosophus Aristoteles in eas penetrare non potuerat. Hoc sensu gravitas qualitas manifesto, et sola gravitatis causa de qua Newtonus nihil statuit, dici potest occulta. Occultam tamen esse in sensu Scholasticorum, ita scilicet ut manifestari non poterit, Newtonus minima statuit. Su D. Leibnitius ludit in verbis et Newtonum calumnia adoritur. Ludit etiam in verbis ub Deum vocat qui non est Dominus Universorum, et animam vocat quo corpus non animatur.

Quæst.24. May not the forces by which the small particles of bodies cohere & act upon one another at small distances for producing the above mentioned phænomena of nature, be electric? For altho electric bodies do not act at a sensible distance unless their virtue be excited by friction, yet that vertue may not be generated by friction but only expanded. For the particles of all bodies may abound with an electric spirit which reaches not to any sensible distance from the particles unless agitated by friction or by some other cause & rarefied by the agitation. And the friction may not rarefy the spirit not of all the particles in the electric body but of those only which are on the outside of it: so that the action of the particles of the body upon one another for cohering & producing the above mentioned phænomena may be vastly greater then that of the whole electric body to attract at a sensible distance by friction. And if there be such an universal electric spirit in body, certainly it must very much influence the motions & actions of the particles of the bodies amongst one another. so that without considering it, philosophers will never be able to give an account of the phænomena arising from those motions & actions. And so far as these phænomena may be performed by the spirit which causes electric attraction it is unphilosophical to look for any other cause.
Quæst 25 Do not all bodies therefore abound with a very subtile active potent elastic spirit by which light is emitted refractec & reflected, electric attractions & fugations are performed, & the small particles of bodies cohere when contiguous, agitate one another at small distances & regulate almost all their motions amongst themselves. For electric - - - - uniting the thinking soul & unthinking body. This spirit may be also of great use in vegetation, wherein three things are to be considered, generation, nutrition & præparation of nourishment.
Generation is nothing else then separating a branch from the tree & giving it better nourishment. If a separated branch takes root in the earth or a separated twigg or bud by grafting or inoculation is nourished from the root of a young stock, it grows into a new tree as big a the tree from which it was separated being better nourished from a young root then from an old one. The seed of a tree has the nature of a branch or twig or bud, while it grows upon the tree it is a part of the tree: but if separated & set in the earth to be better nourished, the embryo or young tree conteined in it takes root & grows into a new tree. like manner The egg of a female with the embryo formed in it while it grows in the ovarium is a branch of the mothers body & partakes of her life, & The embryo is as capable of being separated from the mother & growing great by due nourishment as a branch or twigg or budd or seed of a tree is of being separated from the tree & growing into a new tree. For by the act of generation nothing more is done then to ferment the sperm of the female by the sperm of the male that it may thereby become fit nourishment for the Embryo. For the nourishment of all animals is prepared by ferment & the ferment is taken from animals of the same kind , & makes the nourishment subtile & spiritual. In adult animals the nourishment is fermented by the choler & pancreatic juice, both which come from the blood. The Embryo not being able to ferment its own nourishment which comes from the mothers blood has it fermented by the sperm which comes from the fathers blood, & by this nourishment it swells, drops off from & Ovarium & begins to grow with a life distinct from that of the mother. And in Oviparous creatures if the sperm of the female be not fermented with the sperm of the male the white & the yolk of the egg will not be fit nourishment for the Embryo. [So then the Embryo grows upon the body of the mother before generation as a twig grows upon a tree & all generation is nothing else than the preparation of due nourishments for the Embryo to grow with a distinct life when separated. ]
Now in all fermentation which generates spirits, the ferment abounds with a supprest acid which being more attracted by the other body forsakes its own <235v> to rush upon & dissolve the other & by the violence of the action breaks both its own particles & the particles of the other body into smaller particles & these by their subtilty volatility & continual digestion resolve the whole mass into into as subtile parts as it can be resolved by putrefaction. [And by this means bodies must lose their old form & texture & be destroyed & broken into the last parts before they can be formed.] For as an old house must be pulled down & its stones separated before a new house can be built out of its materials: So natural bodies must be dissolved broken & separated into their least parts by fermentation & putrefaction & lose their old form & texture before a new natural body can be formed out of them.
And when the nourishment is thus prepared by dissolution & subtiliation, the particles of the body to be nourished draw to themselves out of the nourishment the particles of the same density & nature with themselves. For particles of one & the same nature draw one another more strongly then particles of different natures do. And therefore in the bowels of the earth particles of the same nature are apt to assemble in the same masses & those of different natures in different masses. And when many particles of the same kind are drawn together out of the nourishment they will be apt to coalesce in such textures as the particles which drew them did before because they are of the same nature as we see in the particles of salts which if they be of the same kind always crystallize in the same figures. And for faciliating this assimilation of the nourishment & presering the nourished bodies from corruption it may be presumed that as electric attraction is excited by friction so it may be invigorated also by some other causes & particularly by some agitation caused in the electric spirit by the vegetable life of the particles of living substances: & the ceasing of this vigour upon death may be the reason why the death of Animals is accompanied with putrefaction.

These things I have proposed under the heads of Quæres & leave them to be examined.
by such a fermentation as generates convenient spirits.
For all the use which nature makes of such fermentations as generate spirits & are the beginning of putrefaction seems to be for destroying the texture & forms of bodies & breaking their particles into less particles whereby they may become subtile & spiritual & fit nourishment for things which grow. For fermentation & putrefaction destroys & subtilizes & reduce all things to their least particles & nutrition recomposes those particles & sets them together in such an order as to make them become of the same nature with the things nourished.]

De Motu et Sensatione Animalium.
1 Attractionem electricam per spiritum quendam fieri qui corporibus universis inest, et aquam vitrum Crystallum aliaque corpora solida libere permeat libere pervadit. Nam corpora electrica post fortiter attrita aurum foliatum per interpositam aquæ vel vitri substantiam trahunt.

De vita & morte vegetable.
1 Corpora omnia vim habent electricam & vim illam in superficiebus particularum fortissimam esse sed non longe extendi nisi frictione vel alia aliqua actione cieatur.
3 Particulas corporum per vim electricam diversimonde coalescere & cohærere. Et particulas minores fortius agere & artius cohærere.
Particulas menstrui quæ vi electrica particulas linguæ fortissime agitant sensationem acidi ciere.
Menstruum acidum corpora densa dissolvere per particulas suas acidas, vi attractrice in intersticia partium ultimæ compositionis irruentes & partem unamquamque circumeuntes ut cortex nucleum vel atmosphæra terram. partes vero acido circumdatas corpus suum linquere et in Menstruo fluitare, atque acido ambiente linguam pungere excitando sensationem salis. Nam acidum a nucleo incluso attractum retentum & impeditum minus agit in linguam quam prius.
Acidum salis ab externo corpore magis attractum quam a nucleo proprio, in externum illud ruit & nucleus acido nudatus pondere suo decidit & in fundum præcipitatur.
His dissolutionibus particulas acidas vehementer agitari et earum vim electricam per agitationem et frictionem, intendi & longius propagari quam prius & dissolutionem promovere.. Nam vis electrica per frictionem cieri solet.
Particulas acidas dissovendis corporum partibus compositionis ultimæ longe minores esse ut in earum insterstitia irruere possint sed non adeo parvas tamen ut poros harum partium permeent. Ideoque partes immutatæ manent acidoque ambiente nudatæ ut supra & præcipitatæ, si sint metallici generis ut fundi possint per fusionem in corpus antiquum redeunt. Mercurius itidem cum metallis amalgamando commixtum interstitia partium compositionis ultimæ ingreditur, poros autem harum partium ingredi non potest idioque per destillationem abstractus relinquit partes immutatas, & hæ partes per fusionem in corpus pristinum revertuntur.
Si dissolutio ejusmodi est ut per actionem Menstrui et reactionem corporis spiritus aliqui subtiliores excitentur qui poros partium compositionis ultimæ possint ingredi , tunc spiritus illi paulatim permeant & dissolvunt has partes et in particulas compositionis penultimæ separant, perinde ut Menstruum acidum dissolvebat corpus totum et in partes compositionis ultimæ, in casu priore separabat. Et corpus formam veterem jam amisit. Nam particulæ compositionis penultimæ in partes compositionis ultimæ non nisi per generationemm redeunt. Et par est ratio dissolutionis particularum compositionis penultimæ in particulas compositionis ante penultimæ &c. Hasce vero dissolutiones corruptionem corporis et putrefactionem dicere solemus.
Putrefactio per fermentum quandaque inducitur, et fermentum est corpus vegetabile spiritibus abundans qui poros partium compositionis ultimæ permeare possunt & partes illas dissolvere, & dissolvendo novos ejusdem generis spiritus paulatim excitare quibus putrefactio compleatur. Nutrimentum animalium per succos in stomacho et maxime per bilem fermentatur.
Dissolutio corporis in partes compositionis ultimæ violentior est, & cito perficitur & cessat. Ea partium illarum in parti{bus} compositionis penultimæ lente fit diuturnior est & modico peragitur calore qui spiritus subtiliores dissolventes non abigat sed actionem eorum juvet.
Corpus per putrefactionem fractum comminutum & in partes minimas redactum, formam veterem amisit & formarum innumerabilium novarum per generationem est capax. Nam putrefactio corpus comminuit generatio partes minimas congregat. conjungit & in ordinem denuo redigit idque diversimode secundum naturam corporis vivi cui substantia fermentata et putrefacta in nutrimen{} præbetur. Ut cum vegetabilia innumera eodem fimo, animalia innumera eodem cibo per bilem fermentato nutriuntur.
Ut frictione corporis electrici intenditur ejus attractio sic et etiam Actione vivendi intenditur vis electrica partium viventis, & forti attractione fit ut partes illæ formam propriam & situm inter se conservent & nutrimento suo paulatim communicent <237v> perinde ut Manges convertit ferrum in magnetem & ignis convertit corpora in ignem & fermentum convertit pastam in fermentum: at cessante vita vegetabili cessat attractio illa vitalis et ejus defectu simul incipit actio moriendi quam corruptionem & putrefactionem dicimus.
In generatione animalium per misturam et fermentationem seminum attractio vegetabilis cietur & quasi flamma vitalis accenditur qua languescente animal debilitatur & cessante moritur & putrescit: et contra. Ovum in ovario matris ante generationem vivit tantum ut pars corporis materni: at per fermentationem seminum vitam propriam vegetabilem acquirit ut animal a matre diversum, & per hanc vitam statim incipit vegetare ac crescere & nutrimentum in se convertere. [Fermentatio autem per attractionem uti diximus perficitur et motu suo attractionem illam intendit & fortiorem reddit]. Per fermentum itaque corpora mortua dissolvuntur, viva nutriuntur & crescunt. Mortua propter debilem partium attractionem non dissolvuntur sed menstruum vincunt. 
2 Corpora vi electrica plerumque trahi quadoque vero dispelli per experimenta constat; et particulas aeris & vaporum sese dispellere. Particulas etiam olei dispellere particulas aquæ.

Si posset Menstruum alios illos pervadere, vel si auri partes primæ et secundæ compositionis possent separari, fieret aurum vel fluidum vel saltem magis malleabile. Si aurum fermentescere posset [et per digestionem in fimum mollem resolvi vegetabilibus nutriendis aptum, idem & per generationem] in aliud quodvis corpus transformari posset. [ Eadem intellige de aliis corporibus duris & eorum partibus compisitionis ultimæ.
Fluiditas sita est in partium parvitate qua facile commoveantur et lubricitate qua facile labantur inter se. Intellige partes ultimæ compositionis.

Various Conjectures.
Flame is red hot fume & differs from fume which is not red hot as red hot iron differs from iron which is not red hot.
Heat consists in the trembling agitation of the smallest parts of bodies all manner of ways; & the parts of all bodies are always in some agitation.
Earth is the condensed sediment of water & water is fluid earth.
Burning spirits are oyles united with phlegm by fermentation.
Tincture of Cochinell extracted with spirit of wine being powered in small quantity into a great mass of water, tinges the whole water because the particles of the Cochinell are more attracted by the water then by one another, & therefore recede from one another.
Water has but a small power of attracting because it has but a small quantity of acid in its composition. For we call that an acid which attracts & is attracted strongly. Whence it is that those things which dissolved in water are dissolved slowly & without effervescence. But where the attraction is strong & the particles of the menstruum are on all sided attracted by the particles of the metal or rather a particle of the metall is on all sides attracted by the particles of the menstruum, these agitate the particles with violence it & carry it of from the metall, that is they corrode & eat the metall And the same particles applied to the tongue leave the subtile earth to which they adhered & by a greater attraction rush into the liquids of the tongue agitate & disjoyne its parts & cause a painfull sensation by reason of which we call them acid.
In every solution made by a menstruum, the particles to be dissolved are more attracted by the particles of the menstruum then by one another; & therefor leave one another to float in the menstruum.
In every fermentation there is a supprest acid which is coagulated by precipitation upon the body suppressing it
Oyle intimately mixed with a very great quantity of flegm becomes of a nature something saline & so constitutes vinegre whose acid particles if separated from the flegm would be a volatile salt. Under this head tartar is also to be considered
Mercury is attracted that is corroded by acids. And as by its weight it opens obstructions, so by it attractive force it draws acids to it self & suppresses them. suppresses acids. Mercury is volatile & rises easily by heat because its particles of the last composition are small & are easily separated, & being separated endeavour to recede from one another, as happens also in the particles of vapour & rarefied fluids.
Water cannot be comprest because its particles already touch one another. And if air was so far comprest as to make its particles touch one another it might become a stone.

Quæst. Do not all bodies abound with a very subtile active vibrating spirit by which light is emitted reflected & refracted, electric & magnetic attractions & fugations are performed, the small particles of bodies cohære when contiguous, agitate one another at small distances & regulate almost all their motions amongst themselves as the great bodies of the Universe regulate theirs by the power of gravity? For electric bodies could not act at a distance without a spirit reaching to that distance. And by several experiments shewn by Mr Hawksby before the R. Society it appears that a cylindrical rod of glass or hard wax strongly rubbed emitts an electric spirit or vapour which pushes against the hand or face so as to be felt, & upon application of the finger to the electric body crackles & flashes, & that the electric spirit reaches to the distance of half a foot or a foot from the glass or above & passes readily through the solid body of a plate or vessel of glass , the electric body attracting things beyond the glass; & that if a globe of glass be nimbly turned round upon an axis & in turning rub upon a man's hand to excite its electric virtue, the the hand if the glass be empty of air shines through the glass with a purple light, if some air be let into the glass, the whole cavity of the glass appears illuminated with flashes of a whiter light; if the air be let in freely the glass emitts an electric vapour or spirit which may be felt by the hand & which in dashing upon the hand or upon white paper or a handkerchief at the distance of a quarter of an inch or half an inch from the glass or above, illuminates the hand or paper or handkerchief with a white light while the glass continues in motion, the spirit by striking upon those bodies being agitated so as to emit the light. & that if some threds of cotton or worsted yorn hanging by one end at a little distance from one another be attracted at the other end towards the glass, & a mans finger be advanced towards the attracted ends of the threds, the threds will recede from the finger, & this they will do as well when they are within the glass as when they are without it. There is therefore an electric spirit by which bodies are in some cases attracted in others repelled & this spirit is so subtile as to pervade & pass through the solid body of glass very freely in both cases, & is capable of contraction & dilatation expanding it self to great distances from the electric body by friction, & therefore is elastic & susceptible of a vibrating motion like that of air whereby sounds are propagated, & this motion is exceeding quick so that the electric spirit can thereby emit light. And that which emits light in the experiments above mentioned, may emitt it in all shining bodies whenever sufficiently agitated either by heat or by putrefaction. And the Medium which emitts light may also be able to refract & reflect it as was noted above. This spirit may be also the Medium by whose vibrating agitations stirred up within dense bodies, the bodies receive heat & communicate it to contiguous bodies; the vibrations being propagated from one body into another where the bodies are contiguous, but reflected at the surface where they are not contiguous & by reflections kept within the hot body. The like vibrations may be excited in the bottom of the eye by light & propagated thence through the solid capillamenta of the optick nerves into the sensorium for causing vision & the like of other senses. The like vibrations may be also propagated from the brain through the solid fibres of the spinal marrow & its branches into the muscles for agitating & expanding the liquors therein & thereby contracting the muscles to cause the motions of animals. For liquors are expanded <241r> by heat & by consequence by the vibrating agitations of this spirit. If the agitations be of short continuance they expand the liquors without heating them for want of time to do it. If lasting (as in running a race, or in supporting a burden without external motion of the body) they heat the body by degrees & at length excite sweat. This spirit therefore may be the medium of sense of animal motion & by consequence of uniting the thinking soul & unthinking body.
[The vegetable life may also consist in the power of this spirit supposing that this power in substances which have a vegetable life is stronger then in others & reaches to a greater distance from the particles. For as the electric vertue is invigorated by friction so it maybe by some other causes. And by being stronger in the particles of living substances then in others it may preserve them from corruption, & [ from the parti] act upon the nourishment to make it of like form & vertue with the living particles as a magnet turns iron to a magnet & fire turns its nourishment to fire & leaven turns past to leaven. For the living particles may propagate the vibrating motions of their spirit into the contiguous particles of the nourishment & cause the spirit in those particles to vibrate & act after the same manner & by that action to modify the nourishment after the same manner with the living particles.
The life of a vegetable is in the whole vegetable & in every part of it. For every branch & every bud & every seed being duly nourished will grow into a new tree. And in like manner the life of an animal is in the whole female & in every egg of the female. And as the branch or seed of a tree being separated from the tree & put into the earth where it may receive due nourishment may grow into a new tree: so the egg of a female being separated from the body of the female & converged into the womb & duly nourished may grow into a new animal. The nourishment of the seed of a plant is putrid rain water, This sinks into the seed, softens it & sets its parts at liberty to exercise their vegetable life in retaining digesting & converting some part of the water into their own nature. The nourishment of the egg of an animal is the seed of the male & female mixed & fermented together in the act of generation. For all nourishment of animals is prepared by fermentation. That of adult animals is fermented by the choler & pancreatic juce both which come from the blood. That of an Egg or Embrio therin is the feminine sperm fermented with the masculine both which also come from the blood. By fermentation the nourishment is subtilized replenished with spirit & put into motion whereby it acts upon the egg swells it & makes it fall off from the Ovarium But the egg (or Embrio therein) having a vegetable life is not corrupted by the nourishment but overcomes it & digests it into its own nature & grows into an animal. In oviparous creatures where the white & the yolk of the egg are the nourishment of the embrio; if the seed of the male doth not enter the composition of the egg the Embrio will not grow. for want of due nourishment. So then generation is nothing else then preparation of due nourishment for making the Embrio begin to grow. Before generation it grew as a parts of the mothers body, & by growing in that manner was shaped into an Embryo ( for the seeds of trees have young plants in them) by generation it receives new nourishment whereby it begins to grow as an animal distinct from is mother. & the mixture of male & female sperms is only for preparing this nourishment.

All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles for otherwise fluids would not congeale, as water, oyles, Vinegre, & Spirit or oyle of Vitriol do by freezing, Mercury by fumes of Lead, Spirit of Nitre & Mercury by dissolving the Mercury & evaporating the flegm, spirit of wine & spirit of Urin deflegming & mixing them & spirit of Urin & spirit of salt by subliming them together to make salarmoniack. Even the rays of light seem to be hard bodies, for otherwise they would not retain different properties in their different sides. And therefore hardness may be recconed the property of all uncompounded matter. < insertion from the top of f 242v > And therefore since all bodies so far as experience reaches are either hard or may be hardened, we may conclude affirm from experience that they all consist of hard particles. < text from f 242r resumes > At least this seems to be as evident as the universal impenetrability of matter For all bodies so far as experience reaches are either hard or may be hardened & we have no other evidence of universal impenetrability besides a large experience without exception. < insertion from f 242v > A property of all uncompounded matter.

At least this seems to be as evident as the universal impenetrability of matter. For all bodies, so far as experience reaches are either hard or may be hardened & we have no other evidence of universal impenetrability besides a large experience without exception. And if compound bodies may be so very hard as we find some of them to be — — — — their cohesion. < text from f 242r resumes > And if compound bodies may be so very hard as we find many of them to be, & yet are very porous & consist of parts which are only layed together, the simple particles which are void of pores & were never yet divided, must be much harder. For such hard particles being heaped up together can scarce touch one another in more then a few points & therefore must be separable by much less force {then} is requisite to break a solid particle whose parts touch in all the space between them without any pores or interstices to weaken their cohesion ; And how such very hard particles which are only laid together & touch only in points can stick together, & that so firmly as they do, without the assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or prest towards one another is very difficult to conceive.
As in Mathematicks so in Natural Philosophy the investigation of difficult things by Analysis ought ever to precede their Composition. In the two first Books I proceeded by Analysis to discover & prove the original differences of the rays of light in respect of refrangibility reflexibility & colour & their alternate fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission & the properties of bodies both opake & pellucid on which their colours depend: & these discoverys being proved may be assumed as Principles in the Method of Composition for explaining the phænomena arising from them: an instance of which Method I gave in the end of the first Book In this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be discovered hinting several thing{} about light & its effects upon the frame of Nature & leaving the hints to be examined & improved by the further experiments & observations of such as are inquisitive.. And because the knowledge of the degrees of heat may be of use in making & reporting some sorts of experiments relating to this matter, I shall add the following Question.
that God [Deus O. M.] in penetrable moveable properties, & in such for which he created them. And that these original particles being solids are incomparably harder then any porous bodies compounded of them; even so very hard as never to weare or break in pieces; no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the first creation. While these particles continue entire they may compound bodies of like nature & texture in all ages; but should they weare or break in pieces, the nature of things depending on them would be changed. Water & Earth composed of old worn particles & fragments of particles would not be of the same nature & texture now with water & earth composed of entire particles in the beginning2 < insertion from f 242v > 2 It seems to me further that these particles have not only a Vis inertiæ accompanied with such passive Laws of motion as naturaly result from that force, but also that they are endued with certain active Principles of motion such as is that of gravity & that which causes fermentation & the cohesion of bodies. These principles I consider not as occult Qualities resulting from the specific forms of things, but as the general laws of Nature from whence the forms themselves result. To tell us that every species of things is endowed with an occult quality by which it acts is to tell us nothing, but to dening two or three general Principles of motion from Phænomena & afterwards to tell us how the properties & actions of all corporeal things follow from those Principles would be a very great step in Philosophy tho the causes of those Principles were not yet discovered, & therefore I sinple not to propose the Principles of force & motion above mentioned.
Now by the help of these Principles all material things seem to be composed of the hard & solid particles above mentioned variously associated in the first creation, but not without the counsel of an intelligent Agent. For it became him who created them to set them in order < text from f 242r resumes > . Of these solid particles all material things seem to have been composed in the first creation, but not without the intervention of an intelligent Agent. For it became him who created them, to set them in order. And if he did so, its unphilosophical to seek for any other origin of the world, or to pretend that it might arise out of Chaos by the mere laws of nature tho being once formed it may continue by those laws for many ages.. For while Comets move in very excentrick orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the Planets move one & the same way in orbs concentrick6. This uniformity must be allowed the effect of choise. And so the first contrivance of the eyes, ears, brain, heart, lungs, hands, wings,swimming {bodies} & other organs of <242v> sense & motion in animals & the instinct of brutes & insects can be the effect of nothing else then the wisdome & skill of a powerfull ever living Agent who being indivisibly in all places after some such manner as that which thinks in us is in all parts of our sensorium, perceives all things accurately in their true solid dimensions by the immediate presence of the things themselves while that which thinks in us perceives only the superficial pictures of things made in our sensorium by motion; & who is more able by his will to move the bodies in his sensorium & thereby to form & reform the parts of the Universe then we are by ours to move our own bodies. And since space is divisible in infinitum & matter is not necessarily in all places, it must be also allowed that God is able to create particles of matter of several sizes & figures & in several proportions to space & thereby to vary the Laws of Nature, & make worlds of different sorts in several parts of the Universe.
The business of Experimental Philosophy is to find out by experience & observation not how things were created but what is the present frame of Nature. This enquiry should proceed first by Analysis in arguing from things more known to things less known & particularly from effects to causes & from compositions to their ingredients. And when we have found out & established any new causes or ingredients of things we may proceed by Synthesis from those causes as ingredients as Principles to explain their effects & compositions. Of this Method I gave an instance in the first book of these Opticks, investigating first by Analysis the original differences of the rays in respect of refrangibility reflexibility & colour & then from these differences considered as principles compounding explications of the colours made by Prisms, the colours of the Rainbow & those of natural bodies. Most of the second Book was written some years before the First & so is not in so good a method. However it proceeds by Analysis to discover the fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission of the rays, & from thence the explication of the colours of {illeg}les & other then transparent plates, & those of feathers & tinctures are easily compounded.. In this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be discovered about light, hinting several things about its nature & effects & leaving the hints to be examined & improved by the further experiments & observations of such as are curious, till some further Principles shall be established & the explication of their effects compounded. And by pursuing this method till we come to as clear & full a knowledge of the first cause as we can expect from Phænomena, Natural Philosophy will be perfected, & a good foundation will be laid for enlarging the bounds of Moral Philosophy.

All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles. for otherwise fluids would not congeale as water, Byles, vinegre & spirit or oyle of Vitriol, do by freezing, Mercury by fumes of Lead, Spirit of Nitre & Mercury by dissolving the Mercury & evaporating the flegm, spirit of wine & Spirit of Urin by mixing & spirit of Urin & spirit of salt by subliming to make salarmoniac. Even the rays of light seem to be hard bodies for otherwise they would not retain different properties in their different sides. And thefefore hardness may be recconed the property of all uncompounded matter. I say uncompounded because compounded matter may be soft or fluid by the sliding of the hard particles amongst one another. But as for uncompounded matter there seems to be the same evidence of its hardness as of its impenetrability: For we account matter impenetrable only because we find it so by experience in all bodies in which we can try experiments. And if compound bodies are so very hard as we find many of them to be & yet are very porous & consist of parts which are only layed together, the simple bodies which are void of pores & were never yet divided, must be much harder. Now such hard bodies being heaped up together can scarce touch one another in more then points. And how bodies which touch only in points can stick together without the assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or prest towards one another is very difficult to conceive.
And by pursuing this method in other things as well as in light we may hope to discover more & more of the causes of things & to put the discoveries out of dispute till we come to as clear & full a knowledge of the very first cause as we can expect from phænomena. And thereby we shal not only perfect Natural Philosophy but also enlarge the bounds of Moral Philosophy, establishing upon the clear light of Nature the worship of a Deity as well as the love of our Neighbour.
All these things being considered, it seems to me that Deus O. M. in the beginning ) created matter (consisting of hard solid impenetrable moveable & {illeg} particles of such sizes & figures & with such other properties & in such proportion to space as most conduced to the ends for which he created them. That these particles are so very hard as never to weare or break in pieces, no ordinary power being able to divide what the power of God himself made one in the fir creation. While these particles continue entire they wil be fit to compound bodies of one & the same nature & texture in all ages, but should they weare or break in pieces the nature of things depending on them would be changed. Water & Earth composed of old worn particles & fragments of particles would not be of the same nature & texture now with water & earth composed of entire particles in the beginning. Of these particles all material things seem to have been composed in the first creation but not without the intervention of an intelligent Agent. For it became him that created them to set them in order . And if he did so, its unphilosophical to seek for any other origin of the world or to pretend that it might arise out of a Chaos by the mere laws of Nature. For while Comets move in very excentrick Orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the Planets move one & the same way in orbs concentric. This uniformity must be allowed the effect of choise. And so the first contrivance of the eyes ears heart & other organs of sence & motion in animals can be the effect of nothing else then the wisdome & skill of a powerful ever living Agent who being indivisibly in all places perceives all things in their {more} solid dimensions by the immediate presence of the things themselves more perfectly than that which thinks in us perceives only the superficial pictures of things made in our sensorium by motion, & who is more able by his will to move alter & reform them then we are by ours to move our bodies.  The business of Experimental Philosophy is only to find out by experience & Observation not how things were created but what is the present frame of nature. This inquiry must proceed first by Analysis in arguing from effects to causes & from compositions to ingredients. And when we have found the principles [the causes & ingredients of things we may proceed by Synthesis from those Principles to explain the things of this method I gave instances in the two first books. proceeding first by Resolution & then by composition But in this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be discovered, hinting several things here about the nature of light & its effects upon the frame of Nature, & leaving the hints to be examined & improved by the further experiments & observations of such as are curious. And because the knowledge of the degrees of heat may be of use in making & reporting some sorts of Experiments relating to this matter I shal conclude with the following Question.
<243v>
The air in which we breath resists about 10000 times less then quicksilver &if the resistance in a glass well emptied of air should be but two hundred times less then that of the open air it would be two millions of times less then that of quicksilver. And in the heavens it would be still much less, there being exp of rarefying airs above 8000 times. And therefore the Vis inertiæ of the matter in the heavens is much above 2000000 of times less than that of quicksilver. 
The Peripateticks in their Ph
For these particles I reccon to be solid least 
I reccon these particles to be solid, least compound bodies should be porous in infinitum [I reccon them the least in Nature least matter should be actually divided in infinitum &] I reccon them to be hard & heavy as well, as impenetrable because I meet with equal evidence for all three Qualities. For We have the whole course of a large experience for the universal gravity of matter & for the hardness of its particles without any instance to the contrary & we have nothing more for its universal impenetrability. These particles being solid seem to be so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces no ordinary power being able to divide what the power of God himself made one in the first creation. While these particles continue entire they remain fit to compound bodies of one & the same nature & texture in all ages but should they weare or
so that the resistance seems still to decrease in the same proportion with the density of the resisting fluid. For I do not find by any experiments that bodies moving in Quicksilver water & air meet with any other sensible resistance then what arizes from the density & tenacity of those sensible fluids. Now If the resistance in a vessel well emptied of air was but 100 times less then in the open air it would be about a million of times less then in quicksilver. But it seems to be much less in such a vessel & still much less in the heavens above the orb of the Moon. For Mr Boyle has shewed that Air may be rarefied eight or ten thousand times & the heavens are much emptier of air then any vacuum we can make below [& therefore have much less resistance then any such vacuum, & by consequence, are very much above a million of times rarer & emptier of matter then quicksilver.] For since the air is comprest by the weight of the incumbent atmosphere & the density of air is proportional to the force compressing it it follows by computation that at the height of seven miles from the earth the air is twice rarer then at the surface of the earth & at the hight of 14 miles it is four times rarer then at the surface of the earth & at the height of 21, 28, 35, 42, 49, 56, 63, 70 miles it is 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024 times rarer of thereabouts & at the height of 140, 210, 280, miles it is about 1000000, 1000000000, 1000000000000 times rarer & so on

Heat makes many bodies fluid which are not fluid in cold & increases the fluidity of tenacious fluids as of {illeg} & basams 2 & oyles, & thereby decreases their resistance: but it decreases not the resistance of water considerably as it would do
Qu. 24. What are the degrees of heat by which bodies emitt light
<244r>
Qu. 24 What are the degrees of heat requisite for the emission of light & which may be mutually produced by light?
This will be best understood by the following Table
For sulphureous steams ascend frequently out of the bowels of the earth & the Air abound with acids fit to promote fermentation as may be peceived by the rusting of iron & copper in it & by the kindling of fire with a pair of Bellows, & by the dependence of the beating of the heart upon respiration.
And even the gross body of Sulphur beaten into powder & with an equal weight of iron filings & a little water made into a past, acts upon the iron & in four or five hours grows too hot to be touched & emits a flame. And by these experiments compared with the warmth of the interior earth & hot springs, burning mountains, damps earthquakes, hot suffocating exhalations Hurricanes & spouts we may learn that sulphureous steams abound in the bowels of the earth & ferment with minerals &
Qu. 25. Are not the particles of light hard bodies & do not all sensible bodies consist of hard particles.
sometimes take fire & with a great explosion & shaking of the earth burst the caverns in which they are sent up & then the vapor {illeg} by the explosion ex{pirength} through the pores of & earth feels hot & suffocates man & makes Tempests & Hurricanes & causes the land to glide & the sea to bogle & carrys up the water thereof in drops which with their weight fall down again in spouts. Also some sulphureous steams at all times when the earth is dry ascending into the air ferment there with nitrous acids & sometimes taking fire cause lighting & thunder. For the air abounds with acid vapors fit to promote fermentations , as appears by the rusting of iron copper in it & the kindling of fire by blowing & by the dependence of the beating of the heart upon respiration. 
[‡ Now the above mentioned motions are so great & violent as to shew that in fermentations there is new motion in the world generated from other Principles then the usual laws of motion.] Now the above mentioned motions are so great & violent as to shew that in fermentations bodies which almost rest are put into new motions by a very potent Principle which acts upon them only when they approach one another, [& which is much more potent then are the passive laws of motion arising from the Vis inertiæ of the matter.]
It seems therefore that God Deus O. M. in the beginning created hard particles of matter of such sizes & figures & with such other properties & in such a quantity in proportion to space as most conduced to the ends for which they were created, & of these variously convening & moveing amongst one another formed the corporeal {part} of the Univers: & that the various forms & changes which matter dayly undergoes consist only in the various coalitions & separations of these particles while the particles themselves continue entire & unaltered no ordinary power in nature being able to divide what God himself united in the first creation. While these particles continue entire corporeal nature may continue the same, & produce the same sorts of fluids & solids in all ages but should these be broken into less particles, the nature of things would be altered. For the broken particles would scarce {move} & convene & stick together any more in the same manner & form as they do at present, unless reunited by a divine power.
I have hitherto proceeded in this Book by way of Analysis, arguing from effects to causes & from compound bodies to their ingredients. In the first Book I proceeded first by Analysis in searching into the different refrangibility of the rays & the corresponding colours of light & then from those Principles compounded the explications of the colours of light refracted by Prisms those of the Rainbow & those of Natural bodies. In the second Book I proceeded by Analysis in searching oout the fits of easy Reflexion & easy transmission of the rays of light, & then from this Principle compounded a further explication of the colours of natural bodies The subject of those two books is complein <244v> but that of this third Book is very incomplete. Much remains to be discovered concerning the nature of Light , much more concerning the nature of fire & other bodies which emit reflect, refract inflect & stifle it & concerning the heat, motion & powers by which it is emitted reflected refracted inflected & stifled. Many experiments are wanting for completing the Analysis of this part of Nature & coming to a clear & distinct knowledge of all the causes of these things, many more for perfecting the Analysis of all Nature & making a full & clear discovery of all the first Principles of Natural Philosophy. To compass this is a work which requires many heads & hands & a long time & yet this ought to be done before we proceed from the first Principles by Composition to explain {all} Nature.
some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have risen from the mutual actions of Comets & Planets upon one another & which will be apt to increase till this systeme wants a reformation. Such a wonderfull uniformity in the Planetary Systeme must be allowed the effect of choise. And so must the uniformity in the bodies of animal, they having generaly a right side & a left side shaped alike & on either side of their bodies two leggs behind & two arms or two leggs or two wings before upon their shoulders & between their shoulders a neck with a head upon it & in the head two ears, two eyes, a nose, a mouth, & a tongue alike situated.
— — —Moral Philosophy. For if we see clearely by the light of Nature that there is a God, we shall see clearly by the same light of Nature that he is to be acknowledged feared & adored.
This Analysis consists in arguing from from compositions to ingredients, & from motions to the forces producing them & in general from phænomena to their causes, & from particular causes to more general ones till to argument end in the most general. The Synthesis in assuming the causes discovered & established as principles of Philosophy & from them explaining the Phænomena proceeding from them & proving the Explanations. In the two first Books of these Opticks I proceeded — — — — inquisitive. And if Natural Philosophy in all its parts by pursuing this method shall at length be perfected, the bounds of Moral Philosophy will be also enlarged For so far as we can know by Natural Philosophy what power the first cause has over us & what benefits we receive or may expect from him, so far our duty towards him as well as that towards one another will appear to us by the light of nature. And no doubt, if the worship of fals Gods had not blinded the Heathens, their Moral Philosophy would have gone further then to the four Cardinal Vertues, & instead of teaching us to worship the Sun & Moon & dead mens Souls, they would that tought us to worship our true Benefactor
These forces are to be considered here not as occult Qualities which arise from the specific forms of things but as general Principles by which the things themselves are formed; their truth appearing to us Phænomena,, tho their causes be not yet explained.

thence it may understood that the parts of all fusible bodies stick together as well in a slate of fusion as in a slate of congelation.
Now the smallest particles of matter
Whence its easy to understand that what ever cause makes the parts of ice & other hard bodies stick together the same cause will make them stick together when the bodies are melted, tho perhaps not so firmly. For in fusion the parts of bodies are in a motion of sliding amongst themselves. 
And so sulphureous & nitrous spirits meeting in the air ferment with violence & make thunder & lightning.
If equal weights of sulphur poudered & iron filings be make into a past with a little water, though both the ingredients be dry bodies indissolvable in the water yet they act upon one another & in four or five hours grow too hot to be touched & emit a flame. And thence it may be understood that the sulphureous steams which abound in the bowels of the earth meeting with fit matter may cause great fermentations below & heat mineral waters set mountains on fire & getting out into the air may ferment & flash with the acids they meet with there for causing thunder & lightning. For the air abounds with nitrous acids which are very apt to inflame sulphureous exhalations as be seen by blowing a fire
world. Some other Principle was necessary for putting bodies into motion & now they are in motion some other Principle is necessary for conserving the motion. For from the various composition of motion — — — warms all things by the light, Mountains take fire & the inward parts of the earth are constantly warmed & generate hot sulphureous healthful exhalations which breaking forth with violence cause earthquakes tempests & hurricanes, raise or subvert Islands & mountains & sink lakes & carry up the sea in columns & in drops which convening above fall down in spouts.

Why the Barometer stand 60 or 80 inches high.
Why sulphur & iron grow hot & fire & whence Earthquakes Hurricanes & Spouts.
Air promotes the burning of sulphureous bodies & therefore apt to ferment sulphureous vapors for causing Thunder & lightning.
The same thing I infer also from the cohering of two polished marbles in Vacuo & from the standing of Mercury in the barometer at the height of 40 or 60 or 70 inches or above when ever it is will purged of air & carefully poured in so that its parts, be every where contiguous both to one another & to the glass. Some imagin that the Marbles are prest together by an ambient æther | Mercury is prest up into the Tube by the same Ethereal Medium . But if this æther can pass through either the Quicksilver or the glass it will not buoy up the Mercury, & if it can pass through neither of them then Mercury will not subside, as it doth when the glass is knocked to make the quicksilver {part} from it or when the quicksilver hath any bubbles in it which hinder the contact & cohesion of its parts. The like experiment hath been tried with water well purged from Air. If water be congealed by freezing or quicksilver by the fumes of Lead or by being fried with Virdegris, the parts of the congealed fluid stick together so as to compose a hard body: & this experiment of the Barometer shews that they stick together also in a fluid state . And then
Nam calores quos Thermometer calefacta
Thermometer prima vice in calescendo crepuit tanquam si vitrum frangeretur at crepitus post horas tres vel quatuor cessarunt & Thermometer luto obteclas calorem stanni liquefacti pertulit, Deinde in loco frigido posita temporibus æqualibus calores amisit in proportione geometrica.

the matter into smaller parts & making the parts more smooth & slippery: but that part of the resistance which arises from the Vis inertiæ is proportional to the density of the matter cæteris paribus & cannot be diminished by dividing the matter nor by any other means then by decreasing the density. And for these reasons the density of fluid Mediums is very nearly proportional to their resistance. Liquors which differ not much in density, as water, spirit of vine, spirit of turpentine, hot oyle, differ not much in resistance. Water is thirteen or fourteen times lighter then quicksilver & by consequence 13 or 14 times rarer, & its resistance is less then that of quicksilver in the same proportion or thereabouts, as I have found by experiments made with Pendulums. The open Air in which we breath is eight or nine hundred times lighter then water, & by consequence eight or nine hundred times rarer, & accordingly its resistance is less then that of water in the same proportion or thereabouts, as I have also found by experiments made with pendulums; & in thinner Air the resistance is still less & at length by rarefying the Air becomes insensible. For small feathers falling in the open air meet with great resistance but in a tall glass well emptied of air they fall as fast as lead or gold as I have seen tried several times. Whence the resistance seems still to decrease in proportion to the density of the fluid. For I do not find by any experiments that bodies moving in Quicksilver Water or Air meet with any other sensible resistance then what arizes from the density & tenacity of those sensible fluids as they would do if the pores of those fluids & all other spaces were pervaded by a more subtile resisting fluid.. Now if the resistence in a vessel well emptied of Air was but an hundred times less then in the open Air it would be about a million of times less then in quicksilver. But it seems to be much less in such a vessel & still much less in the heavens at the height of three or four hundred miles from the earth or above. For Mr Boyle has shewed that Air may be rarified above ten thousand times in vessels of glass; & the heavens are much emptier of air then any vacuum we can make below. For since the Air is comprest by the weight of the incumbent atmosphere & the density of Air is proportional to the force compressing it, it follows by computation that at the height of about seven miles from the earth the air is four times rarer then at the surface of the earth, & at the height of 14 miles it is sixteen times rarer then at the surface of the earth; & at the height of 21, 28, or 35, miles it is respectively 6{4}, 256, or 1024, times rarer or thereabouts; & at the height of 70, 140, or 210, miles it is about 1000000, 1000000000000 or 1000000000000000000 times rarer, & so on.
Heat promotes fluidity very much by diminishing the tenacity of bodies. It makes many bodies fluid which are not fluid in cold & increases the fluidity of tenacious liquids as of Oyle Balsam & Honey, & thereby decreases their resistance. But it decreases not the resistance of water considerably as it would do if any considerable part of the resistance of water arose from the attrition or tenacity of its parts And therefore the resistence of water arises chiefly almost entirely from the Vis inertiæ of its matter: & by consequence, if the heavens were as dense as water they would not have much less resistence then water; if as dense as quicksilver they would not have much less resistence then quicksilver; if absolutely dense or full of matter without any vacuum, let the matter be never so subtile & fluid, they would have a greater resistence then quicksilver. A solid globe in such a Medium would lose above half its motion in moving three times the length of its diameter & a globe not solid (such as are the Planets) would be retarded sooner. And therefore to make way for the lasting & regular motions of the Planets & Comets, its necessary to empty the heavens of all matter except <247r> perhaps some very thin vapors steams or effluvia arising from the Atmospheres of the Earth Planets & Comets. & such an ethereal Medium as we described above. A dense fluid can be of no use for explaining the phænomena of Nature, the motions of the Planets & Comets being better explained by gravity without it & gravity not being hitherto explained by it. It serves only to disturbe & retard the motions of those great bodies, & make the frame of nature languish & in the pores of bodies it serves only to stop the vibrating motions of their parts wherein their heat & activity consists. And as it is of no use & hinders the operations of Nature & makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its existence & therefore it ought to be rejected. And if it be rejected, the Hypotheses that light consists in pression or motion propagated through such a Medium are rejected with it. And for rejecting such a Medium we have the authority of those the oldest & most celebrated Philosophers of Greece & Phenicia who made a Vacuum, Atoms & the gravity of Atoms the first Principles of their Philosophy; tacitely attributing gravity to some other cause then dense matter or mechanism. Later Philosophers banish the consideration of other causes then mechanism out of natural Philosophy, framing Hypotheses for explaining all things mechanically & referring other causes to Metaphysicks: whereas the main business of natural Philosophy is to argue from Phænomena without feigning Hypotheses & to deduce causes from effects till we come to the very first cause which certainly is not mechanical; & not only to unfold the mechanism of the world but chiefly to resolve these & such like questions. What is there in places almost empty of matter, & whence is it that the Sun & Planets gravitate towards one another without dense matter between them? Whence is it that Nature doth nothing in vain & whence arises all that beauty that we see in the world? To what end are Comets, & whence is it that Planets move all one & the same way in orbs concentric while Comets move all manner of ways in Orbs very excentrick; & what hinders the fixt Stars from falling upon one another? How come the bodies of animals to be contrived with so much art, & for what ends were their severall parts? Was the eye contrived without skill in Opticks & the ear without the knowledge of sounds? How do the motions of the body follow from the will, & whence is the instinct in animals? Is not the sensory of animal that place to which the sensitive substance is present, & into which the sensible species of things are carried through the nerves & brain that there they may be perceived by their immediate presence to that substance? And these things being rightly dispatcht, Does it not appear from phænomena that there is a Being incorporeal living intelligent omnipresent, who in infinite space as it were in his sensory, sees the things themselves intimately, & throughly perceives them, & comprehends them wholy by their immediate presence to himself; of which things the images only carried through the organs of sense to it self, that which in us perceives & thinks, sees & beholds in its little sensorium. And tho every true step made in this Philosophy brings us not immediately to the knowledge of the first cause, yet it brings us nearer to it, & on that account is to be highly valued.

Qu 23. Have not the small partciles of bodies certain powers virtues or forces by which they act at a distance not only upon the rays of light for reflecting refracting & inflecting them but also upon one another for producing a great part of the phænomena of nature? For its well known that bodies act one upon another by the attractions of gravity magnetism & electricity & these instances shew the course & tenour of nature & make it not improbable but that there may be more attractive powers then these. ‡ < insertion from f 248v > ‡ Or that bodies may act at very small distances act by electricall attraction even without friction For Nature is very consonant & conformable to her self. How these attractions may be performed I do not here consider. What I call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to me. I use that word here to signify only in general any force by which bodies tend towards one another whatever be the cause. For we must learn from the phænomena of Nature what bodies {do} attract one another & what are the laws & properties of the attractio before we enquire the cause by which the attraction is performed. The attractions of gravity magnetism & electricity reach to very sensible distances & so have been observed by vulgar eyes & there may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto to escape observations, & perhaps electrical attraction may reach to small distances even without being excited by friction.
For when salt of Tartar runs — — — — < text from f 248r resumes > 
For when salt of Tartar runs per deliquium is not this done by an attraction between the particles of the salt of Tartar & the particles of water which float in the air in the form of vapors? And why does not common salt or saltpeter or vitriol run per deliquium but for want of such an attraction? Or why does not salt of Tartar draw more water out of the air then in a certain proportion to its quantity, but for want of an attractive force after it is satiated with water? And whence is it but from this attractive power that water which alone distills with a gentle lukewarm heat will not destill from salt of Tartar without a great heat? And is it not from the like attractive power between the particles of oyle of Vitriol & the particles of water that Oyle of Vitriol draws to it a good quantity of water out of the air, & after it is satiated draws no more, & in destillation lets go the water very difficultly? And when water & oyle of Vitriol poured successively into the same vessel grow very hot in the mixing, does not this heat argue a great motion in the parts of the liquors? & does not this motion argue that the parts of the two liquors in mixing coalesce with violence & by consequence rush towards one another with an accelerated motion. And when Aqua fortis or Spirit of Vitriol poured upon filings of iron dissolve the filings with a great heat & ebullition is not this heat & ebullition effected by a violent motion of the parts & does not that motion argue that the acid parts of the liquor rush towards the parts of the metal with viloence, & run forcibly into its pores till they get between its outmost particles & the main mass of the metal & surrounding those particles loosen them from the main mass & set them at liberty to flote off into the water? And when the acid particles which alone would destill with an easy heat will not separate from the particles of the metal without a very violent heat does not this confirm the attraction between them?
When salt of Tartar per deliquium being poured into the solution of any metal precipitates the metal & makes it fall down to the bottom of the liquor in the form of mud, does not this argue that the acid particles are attracted more strongly by the salt of Tartar then by the metal & by the stronger attraction go from the metal to the salt of Tartar? And so when a solution of in Aqua fortis dissolves the Lapis Calaminasis & lets go the iron or a solution of Copper dissolves iron immersed in it & lets go the copper, or solution of Silver dissolves Copper & lets go the silver <249r> or a solution of Mercury in aqua fortis being poured upon iron copper tin or lead dissolves the metal & lets go the Mercury, does not this argue that the acid particles of the Aqua fortis are attracted more strongly by the Lapis Calamiriaris then by Iron & more strongly by iron then by copper & more strongly by copper then by silver & more strongly by iron, copper tin & lead then by Mercury? And is it not for the same reason that iron requires more Aqua fortis to dissolve it then copper & copper more then the other metals; & that of all metals iron is dissolved most easily & is most apt to rust; & next after iron, copper?
When spirit of Vitriol poured upon common salt or saltpeter makes an ebullition with the salt & unites with it & in destillation the spirit of the common salt or saltpeter comes over much easier then it would do before & the acid part of the spirit of Vitriol stays behind; does not this argue that the fixed Alcaly of the salt attracts the acid spirit of the Vitriol more strongly then its own spirit, & not being able to hold them both, lets go its own? And when oyle of Vitriol is drawn off from its weight of Nitre & from both the ingredients a compound spirit of Nitre is destilled two parts of which being poured on one part of oyle of cloves or larvy seeds, or of any ponderous vegetable oyle or oyle of animal substances, or oyle of Turpentine thickened with a little balsam of sulphur, grows so very hot in mixing as presently to send up a burning flame: does not this very great & sudden heat argue that the the two liquors mix with violence & that their parts in mixing run towards one another with an accelerated motion & clash with the greatest force? And is it not for the same reason that well rectified spirit of wine poured on the said compound spirit flashes & that the pulvis fulminans composed of sulphur Nitre & salt of Tartar goes off with a more sudden & violent explosion then Gun-powder, the acid spirits of the Sulphur & Nitre rushing towards one another & towards the salt of Tartar with so great a violence as by the shock to turn the whole at once into vapour & flame? Where the dissolution is slow it makes a slow ebullition & a gently heat & where it is quicker it makes a greater ebullition with more heat, & where it is done at once, the ebullition is contracted into a sudden blast or violent explosion with a heat equal to that of fire & flame.
So when a drachm of the above mentioned compound spirit of Nitre was poured upon half a drachm of oyle of Carvi seeds in Vacuo the mixture immediately made a flash like gunpowder & burst the exhausted Receiver which was a glass six inches wide & eight inches deep. And ‡
< insertion from f 248v >
‡And even the gross boy of Sulphur poudered & with an equal weight of iron filings & a little water made into a past, acts upon the iron & in five or six hours grows too hot to be touched & emits a flame. And by these experiments compared with the great quantity of sulphur with which the earth abounds & the warmth of the interior parts of the earth & hot springs & burning mountains, & with damps mineral corruscations, earthquakes, hot suffocating exhalations, hurricanes & spouts; we may learn that sulphureous steams abound in the bowels of the earth & ferment with minerals & sometimes take fire with a sudden corruscation & explosion & if pent up in subterraneous caverns burst the caverns with a great shaking of the earth as in springing of a Mine, & then the vapor generated by the explosion expiring through the pores of the earth feels hot & suffocates & makes tempests & hurricanes & sometimes causes the land to slide or the sea to boyle & carries up the water thereof in drops which by their weight fall down again in spouts. Also some sulphureous steams, at all times when the earth is dry, ascending into the Air, ferment there with nitrous acids, & sometimes taking fire cause lightning & thunder & fiery Meteors. For the Air abounds with acid vapors fit to promote fermentations, as appears by the rusting of iron & copper in it, the kindling of fire by blowing, & the beating of <249v> the heart by means of respiration. Now the above mentioned motions are so great & violent as to shew that in fermentations the particles of bodies which almost rest are put into new motions by a very potent principle which acts upon them only when they approach one another & causes them to meet & clash with great violence & grow hot with the motion & dash one another into pieces & vanish into air & vapour & flame.

When Oyle of Vitriol is mixed with a little water or is run per deliquium & in destillation the water ascends difficultly & brings over with it some part of the Oyle of Vitriol in the form of spirit of Vitriol & this spirit being poured upon iron copper or salt of Tartar unites with the body & lets go the water, does not this shew that the acid spirit is attracted by the water & more attracted by the fixt body then by the water & therefore lets go the water to close with the fixt body? And is it not for the same reason that the water & acid spirits in Vinegar, Aqua fortis & Spirit of Salt cohere & rise together in destillation; but if the Menstruum be poured on salt of Tartar, or on Lead or Iron or any fixt body which it can dissolve, the acid by a stronger attraction adheres to the body & lets go the water? And is it not also from a mutual attraction that the spirits of soot & sea salt unite & compose the particles of Salarmoniac which are less volatile then before because grosser & freer from water; & that the particles of Salarmoniac in sublimation carry up the particles of Antimony which will not sublime alone; & that the particles of Mercury uniting with the acid particles of spirit of salt compose Mercury sublimate, & with the particles of sulphur compose cinnaber; & that the particles of spirit of wine & spirit of urine well rectified unite & letting go the water which dissolved them compose a consistent body;; & that in subliming cinnaber from Salt <250r> of tartar or quick lime the sulphur by a stronger attraction of the salt or lime lets go the Mercury & stays with the fixt body, & that when Mercury sublimate is sublimed from Antimony or from Regulus of Antimony, the spirit of salt lets go the Mercury & unites with the Antimonial metal which attracts it more strongly & stays with it till the heat be great enough to make them both ascend together, & then carries up the metal with it in the form of a very fusible salt called butter of Antimony, although the spirit of salt alone be almost as volatile as water & the Antimony alone as fixt as lead?
When Aqua fortis dissolves silver & not gold & Aqua regia dissolves gold & not silver may it not be said that Aqua fortis is subtile enough to penetrate Gold as well as silver but wants the attractive force to give it entrance, & that Aqua regia is subtile enough to penetrate silver as well as Gold but wants the attractive force to give it entrance. For Aqua regia is nothing else then Aqua fortis mixed with some spirit of salt or with salarmoniac & even common salt dissolved in Aqua fortis enables the menstruum to dissolve Gold tho the salt be a gross body. When therefore spirit of salt precipitates silver out of Aqua fortis is it not done by attracting & mixing with the Aqua fortis & not attracting or perhaps repelling the silver; & when water precipitates Antimony out of the sublimate of Antimony & Salarmoniac or out of butter of Antimony is it not done by dissolving mixing with & weakning the salarmoniac or spirit of salt & not attracting or perhaps repelling the Antimony? And is it not from the want of an attractive vertue between the parts of water & oyle, of Quicksilver & Antimony, of Lead & Iron that these substances do not mix & by a weak attraction that quicksilver & copper mix difficultly & from a strong one that Quicksilver & Tin, Antimony & iron, water & salts mix readily? And in general, is it not from the same principle, that heat congregates homogeneal bodies & separates heterogeneal ones?
When Arsenick with soap gives a Regulus & with Mercury sublimate a volatile fusible salt like butter of Antimony, does not this shew that Arsenick is compounded of fixt & volatile parts strongly cohering by a mutual attraction so that the volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? And so when an equal weight of spirit of wine & oyle of Vitriol are digested together & in destillation yeild two fragrant volatile spirits which will not mix with one another & a fixt black earth remains behind, doth not this shew that oyle of Vitriol is composed of volatile & fixed parts strongly united by attraction so as to ascend together in form of a volatile acid fluid salt, untill the spirit of wine attracts & separates the volatile parts from the fixed? And therefore since oyle of Sulphur per campanam is of the same nature: with oyle of Vitriol, may it not be inferred that sulphur is also a mixture of volatile & fixed parts so strongly cohering by attraction as to ascend together in sublimation. By 
< insertion from f 250v >
By dissolving flowers of Sulphur in oyle of Turpentine & destilling the solution, it is found that sulphur is composed of an inflammable volatile thick oyle or fat bitumen, an acid salt, a very fixt earth & a little metal. The three first were found not much unequal to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to be worth considering. The acid salt dissolved in water is the same with oyle of sulphur per campanam, & abounding much in the bowels of the earth & particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other ingredients of the Markasite, which are Bitumen, Iron, Copper & earth & with them compounds Alume Vitriol & Sulphur. With the earth alone it compounds Alume, with the metal alone or metal & earth together it compounds Vitriol, & with the Bitumen & Earth it compounds Sulphur whence it comes to pass that Markasites abound with those three minerals. And is it not from the mutual attraction of the ingredients that they stick together for compounding these minerals, & that the Bitumen carries up the other ingredients of the sulphur, which without it would not sublime? And the same Question may be put concerning all or almost all the gross bodies in nature. For all the parts of animals & vegetables are composed or substances volatile & fixed fluid & solid as appears by their Analysis, & so are salts & minerals so far as Chymists have been hitherto able to examin their composition

✝Doe not the sharp & pungent tasts of acids arise from the strong attraction whereby the acid particles rush upon & agitate the particles of the tongue? And when metalls are dissolved in acid menstruums & the acids in conjunction with the metal act after a different manner so that the compound has a different tast much milder then before & sometimes a sweet one is it not because the acids adhere to the metallick particles & thereby lose much of their activity?? And if the acid be in too small a proportion to make the compound dissolvable in water, will it not by adhering strongly to the metal become unactive & lose its tast & the compound be a tastless earth? For such things as are not dissolvable by the moisture of the tongue act not upon the tast.
As gravity makes the sea flow round < text from f 251r resumes > makes the sea flow round the denser & weightier parts of the globe of the earth so the attraction may make the watry acid float round the denser & compacter particles of earth for composing the particles of salt. For otherwise the acid would not do the office of a medium between the earth & common water for making salts dissolvable in the water nor would salt of tartar readily draw off the acid from dissolved metalls. nor metals the acid from Mercury. Now as in the great globe of the earth & sea the densest bodies by gravity sink down in water & always endeavour to go towards the center of the globe so in particles of salt the densest matter will always endeavour to approach the center of the particle: so that a particle of salt may be compared to a chaos, being dense hard dry & earthy in the center & rare soft moist & watry in the circumference. And hence it seems to be that salts are of a lasting nature being scarce destroyed unless by drawing away their watry parts by violence or by letting them soak into the pores of the central earth by a gentle heat in putrefaction untill the earth be dissolved by the water & separated into smaller particles which by reason of their smalness make the rotten compound appear of a black colour. Hence also it may be that the parts of animals & vegetables preserve their several forms & assimilate their nourishment, the soft & moist nourishment easily changing its texture by a gentle heat & motion till it becomes like the dense hard dry & durable earth in the center of each particle. But when the nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated or the central earth grows too feeble to assimilate it, the motion ends in putrefaction & death.
If a very small quantity of any salt or Vitriol be dissolved in a great quantity of water the particles of the salt or Vitriol will not sink to the bottom tho they be heavier in specie then the water but will eavenly diffuse themselves into all the water so as to make it as saline at the top as at the bottom. And does not this imply that the parts of the salt or Vitriol recede from one another & endeavour to expand themselves & get as far asunder as the quantity of water will allow in which they float? And does not this endeavour imply that they have a repulsive force by which they fly from one another or at least that they attract the water more strongly then they do one another? For as all things ascend in water which are less attracted then water by the gravitating power of the earth, so all the particles of salt which float in water & are less attracted then water by any one particle of salt must recede from that particle & give way to the more attracted water
When any saline liquor is evaporated to a cuticle & let cool, the salt concretes in regular figures, which argues that the particles of salt <252r> before they concreted, floated in the liquor at equal distances in rank & file & by consequence that they acted upon one another by some power which at equal distances is equal at unequal distances unequal. For by such a power they will range themselves uniformly & without it they will float irregularly & come together as irregularly. And since the particles of Island Crystal act all the same way upon the rays of light for causing the unusual refraction, may it not be supposed that in the formation of this crystal the particles not only ranged themselves in rank & file for concreting in regular figures but also by some kind of polar vertue turned their homogeneal sides the same way.
The parts of all homogeneal hard bodies which fully touch one another stick together very strongly. And for explaining how this may be some have invented hooked atoms which is begging the question; & others tell us that bodies are glued together by rest i.e. by an occult Quality, or rather by nothing, & others that they stick together by conspiring motions, that is, by rest amongst themselves.: I had rather infer from their cohesion that their particles attract one another by some force which in immediate contact is exceeding strong, at small distances performs the chymical operations above mentioned & reaches not far from the particles with any sensible effect.   < insertion from f 253r > All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles, for otherwise fluids would not congeale, as water, oyles, Vinegre, & spirit or oyle of Vitriol do by freezing, Mercury by fumes of Lead, Spirit of Nitre & Mercury by dissolving the Mercury & evaporating the flegm, spirit of Wine & spirit of Urine by deflegming & mixing them, & spirit of Urine & spirit of salt by subliming them together to make salarmoniac. Even the rays of light seem to be hard bodies, for otherwise they would not retain different properties in their different sides. And therefore hardness may be recconed the property of all uncompounded matter. At least this seems to be as evident as the universal impenetrability of matter. For all bodies, so far as experience reaches, are either hard or may be hardened, & we have no other evidence of universal impenetrability besides a large experience without exception. Now if compound bodies are so very hard as we find some of them to be & yet are very porous & consist of parts which are only laid together the simple particles which are void of pores & were never yet divided must be much harder. For such hard particles being heaped up together can scarce touch one another in more then a few points & therefore must be separable by much less force then is requisite to break a solid particle whose parts touch in all the space between them without any pores or interstices to weaken their cohesion. And how such very hard particles which are only laid together & touch only in a few points can stick together, & that so firmly as they do, without the assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or prest towards one another, is very difficult to conceive. < text from f 252r resumes > < insertion from f 252v > The same thing I infer also from the cohering of two polished marbles in Vacuo, & from the standing of Quicksilver in the Barometer at the height of 50 60 or 70 inches or above whenever it is well purged of air & carefully poured in, so that its' parts be every where contiguous both to one another & to the glass. Some imagin that the Marbles are prest together by an ambient æther, & that the Quicksilver is prest up into the Tube by the same æther. But if this æther can pass through either the Quicksilver or the glass it will not press the Quicksilver up into the glass & if it can pass through neither of them it will not let the Quicksilver subside, as it doth whenever the glass is knocked to make the Quicksilver part from it or whenever the Quicksilver hath any bubbles in it which hinder the contact & cohesion of its parts.  < insertion from the bottom of f 253r > Yet if the æther be rarer between the particles then in open & free spaces, it may press them together by its excess of density. < text from f 252v resumes > The like experiment hath been tried with water well purged from air. If Quicksilver be congealed by the fumes of Lead or water be congealed by freezing, the parts of the congeled fluid stick together so as to compose a hard body: & by this experiment of the Barometer it appears that they stick together also in a state of fluidity. Whence its easy to understand that what ever cause makes the parts of ice & hard metalls stick together the same cause makes them stick together when the bodies are melted, tho perhaps not so firmly. For in fusion the parts of bodies are in a motion of sliding amongst themselves.  < insertion from the bottom of f 252v >  And of the same kind with these experiments is this experiment that water ascends in very slender glass pipes (even in Vacuo as soon as the lower ends of the pipes are dipped into the stagnant water; & the narrower are the pipes, the greater is the ascent. And there is the same cause of philtration, & of the ascent of water in the form of an Hyperbola between two planes of glass inclined to one another in a very acute angle & dipt perpendicularly into the liquor, whether the experiment be tried in the open air or in vacuo. < text from f 252v resumes >

If the body is compact & bends or yeilds inward to pression without any sliding of its parts, it is hard & elastic

If they slip easily & are of a fit size to be agitated by heat & the heat is big enough to keep them in agitation, the body is fluid, & if it be apt to stick to things it is humid; & the drops of every fluid affect a round figure by ‡ < insertion from f 252v > ‡ the mutual attraction of their parts as the globe of the earth & sea affects a round figure by the mutual attraction of its parts by gravity. < text from f 252r resumes > 
Since metals dissolved in acids attract but a small quantity of the acid, their attractive force can reach but to a small distance from them. And as in Algebra, where affirmative quantities vanish & cease there negative ones begin: so in Mechanicks, where attraction ceases there a repulsive vertue ought to succeed. And that there is such a vertue seems to follow from the reflexions & inflexions] of the rays of light. For the rays are repelled by bodies in both these cases without the immediate contact of the reflecting or inflecting body. It seems also to follow from the emission of light, the ray so soon as it is shaken off from a shining body by the vibrating motion of the parts of the body & gets beyond the reach of attraction, being driven away with exceeding great velocity. For that force which is sufficient to turn it back in reflexion may be sufficient to emit it. It seems also to follow from the production of air & vapor: The particles when they are shaken off from bodies by heat or fermentation so soon as they are beyond the reach of the attraction of the body, receding from <254r> it & also from one another with great strength, & keeping at a distance. # < insertion from the top of f 253v > # so as sometimes to take up above a million of times more space then they did before in the form of a dense body. Which vast contraction & expansion seems unintelligible by feigning the particles of Air to be springy & ramous or rolled up like hoops, or by any other means then a repulsive power. < text from f 254r resumes > The particles of fluids which do not cohere too strongly & are of such a smalness as renders them most susceptible of those agitations which keep liquors in a fluor, are most easily separated & rarefied into vapour, & in the language of the Chymists they are volatile, rarefying with an easy heat & condensing with cold. But those which are grosser & so less susceptible of agitation or cohere by a stronger attraction are not separated without a stronger heat or perhaps not without fermentation And these last are the bodies which Chemists call fixed & being rarefied by fermentation become true permanent air: those particles receding from one another with the greatest force & being most difficulty brought together which upon contact cohere most strongly. And because the particles of permanent air are grosser & arise from denser substances then those of vapors, thence it is that true air is more ponderous then vapor & that a moist Atmosphere is lighter then a dry one quantity for quantity, .  < insertion from the middle of f 253v >  < text from f 254r resumes > From the same repelling power it seems to be that flys walk upon water without wetting their feet; & that the Object-glasses of long Telescopes lye upon one another without touching; & that dry pouders are difficultly made to touch one another so as to stick together, unless by melting them or wetting them with water which by exhaling may bring them together, & that two polished Marbles which by immediate contact stick together are difficultly brought so close together as to stick.
And thus Nature will be very conformable to her self & very simple, performing all the great motions of the heavenly bodies by the attraction of gravity which intercedes those bodies, & almost all the small ones of their particles by some other attractive & repelling power which intercedes the particles. . The Vis inertiæ is a passive principle by which bodies persist in their motion or rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing it, & resist as much as they are resisted. By this principle alone there could never have been any motion in the world. < insertion from f 252v >  < text from f 254r resumes > 
Some other Principle was necessary for putting bodies into motion, & now they are in motion some other Principle is necessary for conserving the motion. For from the various composition of two motions tis very certain that there is not always the same quantity of motion in the world. For if two globes joyned by a slender rod revolve about their common center of gravity with an uniform motion while that center moves on uniformly in a right line drawn in the plane <255r> of their circular motion, the summ of the motions of the two globes as often as the globes are in the right line described by their common center of gravity will be bigger then the summ of their motions when they are in a line perpendicular to that right line. By this instance it appears that motion may be got or lost; but by reason of the tenacity of fluids & attrition of their parts & the weakness of elasticity in solids, motion is much more apt to be lost then got, & is always upon the decay. For bodies which are either so absolutely hard or so soft as to be void of elasticity, will not rebound from one another. Impenetrability makes them only stop. If two equal bodies meet directly in vacuo they will be the laws of motion stop where they meet & lose all their motion & continue to rest, unless they be elastick & receive new motion from their spring. If they have so much elasticity as suffices to make them rebound with a quarter or half or three quarters of the force with which they came together they will lose three quarters or half or a quarter of their motion. And this may be tried by letting two equal pendulums fall against one another from equal heights. If the pendulums be of lead or soft clay they will lose all or almost all their motion: if of elastic bodies, they will lose all but what they recover from their elasticity. If three equal round vessels be filled the one with water the other with oyle the third with molten pitch & the liquors be stirred about alike to give them a vortical motion: the pitch by its tenacity will lose its motion quickly, the oyle being less tenacious will keep it longer & the water being least tenacious will keep it longest but yet will lose it in a short time. Whence its easy to understand that if many contiguous Vortices of molten pitch were each of them as large as the Cartesian, yet these & all their parts would by their tenacity & stifness communicate their motion to one another till they all rested among themselves. Vortices of oyle or water or some fluider matter might continue longer in motion but unless the matter were void of all tenacity & attrition of parts & communication of motion (which is not to be supposed) the motion would constantly decay. Seing therefore the variety of motion which we see in the world is always decreasing, there is a necessity of conserving & recruiting it by active principles; such as are the cause of gravity by which Planets & Comets keep their motions in their Orbs & all bodies acquire great motion in falling; & the cause of fermentation by which the heart & blood of animals are kept in perpetual motion & heat, the inward parts of the earth are constantly warmed bodies burn & shine, mountains take fire, the caverns of the earth are blown up & the Sun continues violently hot & lucid & warms all things by his light. <256r> . For we meet with very little motion in the world besides what is visibly oweing to these active principles, & the power of the will

Qu. 21. Are not the rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining substances & refracted by mean of certain attractions which intercede them & the parts of pellucid bodies. For such bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in right lines without bending into the shadow, which is the nature of the rays of light. They will also be capable of several properties & be able to conserve their properties unchanged in passing through several Mediums, which is another condition of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon the rays of light at a distance in refracting reflecting & inflecting them & the rays mutualy agitate the parts of those substances at a distance for heating them; & this action & reaction at a distance very much resembles an attractive force. If refraction be performed by attraction of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction in a given proportion as we shewed in our Principles of Philosophy, & this Rule is true by experience. The rays of light in going out of glass into a Vacuum are bent towards the glass, and if they fall too obliquely on the Vacuum they are bent backwards into the glass & totaly reflected, & this reflexion cannot be ascribed to the resistance of the Vacuum, but must be caused by the power of the glass attracting the rays at their going out of it into the Vacuum & bringing them back. For if the further surface of the glass be moistened with water or clear oyle or liquid & clear honey, the rays which would otherwise be reflected will go into the water oyle or honey, & therefore are not reflected before they arrive at the further surface of the glass & begin to go out of it. If they go out of it into water oyle or honey they go on, because the attraction of the glass is almost ballanced & rendred ineffectual by the contrary attraction of the liquor; but if they go out of it into a vacuum which has no attraction to ballance that of the glass, the attraction of the glass either bends & refracts them or brings them back & reflects them. ✝ < insertion from f 257br > ✝And this is still more evident by laying together two Prisms of Glass or two Object glasses of very long Telescopes the one plane the other a little convex, & so compressing them that they do not fully touch nor are too far asunder. For the light which falls upon the further surface of the first glass where the interval between the glasses is not above the ten hundred thousandth part of an inch will go through that surface & through the air or {vacuum} between the glasses & enter into the second glass as was explained in the 1st 4th & 8th Observations of the first Part of the second Book. But if the second glass be taken away the light which goes out of the second surface of the first glass into the Air or Vacuum will not go on forward but turns back into the 1st glass & is reflected; & therefore it is drawn back by the power of the first glass there being nothing else to cause it to turn back. < text from f 257r resumes > Nothing more is requisite for producing all the variety of colours & degrees of refrangibility then that the rays of light be bodies of different sizes, the least of which may make violet the weakest & darkest of colours & be more easily diverted by refracting surfaces from the right course, & the rest as they are bigger & bigger may make the stronger & more lucid colours blue green yellow & red, & be more & more difficultly diverted. Nothing more is requisite for putting the rays of light into fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission then that they be small bodies which by their attractive powers or some other force stir up vibrations in what they act upon, which vibrations being swifter then the rays, overtake them successively & agitate them so as by turns to increase & decrease their velocity & thereby putt them into those fits. And lastly the unusual refraction of Island Crystal looks very much as if it were performed by some kind of attractive vertue lodged in certain sides both of the rays & of the particles of the crystal. For were it not for some kind of disposition or vertue lodged in some sides of the particles of the crystal & not in their other sides, & which inclines & bends the rays towards the coast of unusual refraction; the rays which fall perpendicularly on the crystall would not be refracted towards that coast rather then towards any other coast both at their incidence & at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by a contrary situation of the coast of unusual refraction at the second surface; the crystal acting upon the rays after they have past through it & are emerging into the air, or, if you please, into a vacuum. And <258r> since the crystal by this disposition or vertue does not act upon the rays unless when one of their sides of unusual refraction looks towards that coast, this argues a vertue or disposition in those sides of the rays which answers to & sympathizes with that vertue or disposition of the crystal, almost as the poles of two Magnets answer to one another. And as magnetism may be intended & remitted, & is found only in the Magnet & in iron: so this vertue of refracting the perpendicular rays is greater in Island Crystal less in Crystal of the rock & is not yet found in other bodies. I do not say that this vertue is magnetical: It seems to be of another kind. I only say that what ever it be, its difficult to conceive how the rays of light unless they be bodies can have a permanent vertue in two of their sides which is not in their other sides & this without any regard to their position to the space or medium through which they pass.
<259r>
Qu. 22. Are not gross bodies & light convertible into one another: & may not bodies receive their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition? For all fixt bodies being heated emit light so long as they continue sufficiently hot, & light mutualy stops in bodies as often as its rays strike upon their parts, as we shewed above. I know no body less apt to shine then water, & yet water by frequent destillations changes into fixed earth as Mr Boyle has tried & then this earth being enabled to endure a sufficient heat shines by heat like other bodies. The changing of bodies into light & light into bodies is very conformable to the course of nature, which seems delighted with transmutations Water, which is a very fluid volatile tastless salt, she changes by heat into vapour which is a sort of air, & by cold into ice which is a hard pellucid brittle fusible stone: & this stone returns into water by heat & vapour returns into water by cold. Earth by heat becomes fire & by cold returns into Earth. Dense bodies by fermentation rarefy into several sorts of air & this air by fermentation & sometimes without it returns into dense bodies. Mercury appears sometimes in the form of a fluid metal, sometimes in the form of a hard brittle metal, sometimes in the form of a corrosive pellucid salt called sublimate, sometimes in the form of a tastless pellucid volatile white earth called Mercurius dulcis, or in that of a red opake volatile earth called Cinnaber, or in that of a red or white precipitate, or in that of a fluid salt, & In destillation it turns into vapour. & Being agitated in vacuo it shines like fire. And after all these changes it returns again into Mercury. Eggs grow from insensible magnitudes & change into animals, Tad-poles into Frogs & worms into Flyes. All Birds Beasts & Fishes Insects Trees & other Vegetables with their several parts, grow out of water & watry tinctures & salts, & by putrefaction return again into watry substances. And water standing a few days in the open air yeilds a tincture which (like that of Mault) by standing longer yeilds a sediment & a spirit, but before putrefaction is fit nourishment for animals & vegetables. And among such various & strange transmutations why may not Nature change bodies into light & light into bodies?
Now in bodies of the same kind & vertue attraction is strongest in the smallest bodies in proportion to their bulk. It is found stronger in small magnets for their weight then in great ones. For the parts of small ones being closer together unite their forces more easily. And therefore since the rays of light are the smallest bodies known to us we may expect to find their attractions very strong. And how strong they are may be gathered by this Rule. The attraction of a ray of light in proportion to the quantity of its matter is to the gravity of a projectile in proportion to the quantity of its matter in a compound ratio of the velocity of the ray of light to the velocity of the projectile twice & of the bent or curvity of the ray in the place of refraction to the bent or curvity of the line described by the projectile supposing the inclination of the ray to the refracting surface & that of the projectile to the horizon to be alike. And by this proportion I reccon the attraction of the rays of light to be above <260r> ten hundred thousand thousand millions of times greater then the weight of bodies on the surface of this earth in proportion to the matter in them, supposing that light comes from the sun to us in about seven or eight minutes of an hour. And in immediate contact of the rays their force may be still much greater. And so great a force in the rays cannot but have a very great effect upon the particles of matter with which they are compounded for causing the particles to attract one another & for putting them in motion amongst themselves: for the better understanding of which I will propose the following Quæstion.
<261r>
Qu. 17. If a stone be thrown into stagnating water, the waves excited thereby continue some time to arise in the place where the stone fell into the water, & are propagated from thence in concentric circles upon the surface of the water to great distances. And the vibrations or tremors excited in the Air by percussion continue a little time to move from the place of percussion in concentric spheres to great distances. And in like manner when a ray of light falls upon the surface of any pellucid body & is there refracted or reflected: may not vibrations be thereby excited in the refracting or reflecting Medium at the point of incidence, & continue to arise there & to be propagated from thence as long as when they are excited in the bottom of the eye by the pressure & motion of the finger, or by the light which comes from the coale of fire in the experiments above mentioned? And are not these vibrations propagated from the point of incidence to great distances? And do they not overtake the rays of light, & by overtaking them successively, do they not put them into the fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission described above? For if the rays endeavour to recede from the densest part of the vibration they may be alternately accelerated & retarded by the vibrations overtaking them.
Qu. 18. If in two large & tall cylindrical vessels of glass inverted, two little Thermometers be suspended so as not to touch the vessels; & the air be drawn out of one of these vessels, & these vessels thus prepared be carried out of a cold place into a warm one: the Thermometer in vacuo will grow warm as much & almost as soon as the Thermometer which is not in vacuo. And when the Vessels are carried back into the cold place, the Thermometer in vacuo will grow cold almost as soon as the other Thermometer. Is not the heat of the warm room conveyed through the Vacuum by the vibrations of a much subtiler Medium then Air, which, after the Air was drawn out, remained in the Vacuum? And is not this Medium the same with that Medium by which light is refracted & reflected, & by whose vibrations light communicates heat to bodies & is put into fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission?  < insertion from the top of f 261v >  And Do not the vibrations of this Medium in hot bodies, contribute to the duration of their heat? And do not hot bodies communicate their heat to contiguous cold ones by the vibrations of this Medium propagated from them into the cold ones? And is not this Medium exceedingly more rare & subtile then the Air & exceedingly more elastic & active? < text from f 261r resumes > And doth not this Medium readily pervade all bodies? And is it not by its elastic force expanded through all the heavens?
Q. 19. Doth not the refraction of light proceed from the different density of this æthereal Medium in different places, the light receding from the denser parts of the Medium? And is not the density thereof greater in free & open spaces void of Air & other grosser bodies, then within the pores of water glass crystal gemms & other compact bodies? For when light passes through glass or crystall & falling very obliquely upon the further surface thereof is totally reflected , the total reflexion ought to proceed rather from the density & vigour of the Medium without & beyond the glass, then from the rarity & weakness thereof.
Qu. 20. Doth not this Æthereal Medium in passing out of water glass crystal & other compact & dense bodies into empty spaces grow denser & denser by degrees, & by that means refract the rays of light not in a point but by bending them gradually in curve lines? And doth not the gradual condensation of this Medium extend to some distance from the bodies, & thereby cause the inflexions of the rays of light which pass by the edges of compact bodies at some distance from the bodies?
<262r>
Qu. 21. Is not this Medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun, Starrs, Planets & Comets, then in the celestial spaces, between them, & in passing from them to great distances doth it not grow denser & denser perpetually & thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, & their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer? For if this Medium be rarer within the Sun's body then at its surface, & rarer there then at the distance of the hundredth part of any inch from its body, & rarer there than at the tenth part of an inch from its body, & rarer there then at the orb of Saturn: I see no reason why the increase of density should stop any where & not rather be continued through all distances from the Sun to Saturn, & beyond. And tho this increase of density may at great distances be exceeding slow yet if the elastick force of this Medium be exceeding great, it may suffice to impell bodies from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer with all that power which we call gravity. And that the elastick force of this Medium is exceeding great, may be gathered from the swiftness of its vibrations. Sounds move about 1140 English feet in a second minute of time, & in seven or eight minutes of time they move about one hundred English miles. Light moves from the Sun to us in about seven or eight minutes of time, which distance is about 70000000 English miles, supposing the horizontal Parallax of the Sun to be about 12″. And the vibrations or pulses of this Medium, that they may cause the alternate fits of easy transmission & easy reflexion, must be swifter then light, & by consequence above 700000 times swifter than sounds. And therefore the elastick force of this Medium in proportion to its density must be above 700000 x 700000 times greater then the elastic force of the Air is in proportion to its density. For in elastic Mediums of equal density, the elasticity must be in a duplicate ratio of the velocity of the pulses. And if the density be increased or diminished & the elasticity be increased or diminished in the same proportion, the velocity will remain the same < insertion from the middle of f 261v > & if the elasticity & density be encreased or decreased in one & the same proportion the velocity will remain the same. < text from f 262r resumes > 
< insertion from f 261v > Qu. 22. May not Planets & Comets & all other gross bodies perform their motions more freely & with much less resistance in this Æthereal Medium then in a fluid which fills all space adequately without leaving any pores, & by consequence is much denser then quicksilver or gold? And may not its resistance be so small as to be inconsiderable? For instance: If this Æther (for so I will call it) should be supposed 700000 times more elastick then Air & above 700000 times more rare; its resistance would be above 600000000 times less then that of water. And so small a resistance would scarce make any sensible alteration in the motions of the Planets in ten thousand years. If any one would ask how a Medium can be so rare, let him tell me first how the Air in the upper parts of the Atmosphere can be above ten hundred thousand times rarer then gold. < text from f 262r resumes > 
Qu. 23. Is not vision performed by the vibrations of this Medium excited in the bottom of the eye by the rays of light & propagated through the solid pellucid & uniform capillamenta of the optic nerves into the place of sensation? And is not hearing performed by the vibrations either of this or some other Medium excited in the auditory nerves by the tremors of the Air & propagated through the solid pellucid & uniform capillamenta of those nerves into the place of sensation? And so of the other senses. < insertion from f 261v > < text from f 262r resumes > 
Qu. 24. Is not animal motion performed by the vibrations of this Medium excited in the brain by the power of the will, & propagated from thence through the solid pellucid & uniform capillamenta of the nerves into the muscles for contracting & dilating them? I suppose the single capillamenta of the nerves to be solid & uniform that the motion may be propagated along them uniformly & without interruption. For obstructions in the Nerves create Palsies. And that they may be uniform, I suppose them when viewed singly to be pellucid, tho the reflexions in their surfaces may make the whole nerve (composed of a great number of capillamenta) appear opake & while. For if the capillamenta be not pellucid the reflexions of light from their inward parts, will argue that those parts are not continued but have reflecting surfaces by which they are interrupted & distinguished from one another.
The force of resistance arises only from the density of the Medium & is proportionall to the □ of the velocity of the moving body & will not put a resting body into motion. the force of gravity is here deduced from the elasticity of the medium, & from the variation of it density without any regard to the velocity of the body & may put a resting body into motion. And while these two forces depend upon different causes, the one may be very small & the other very great.

Qu. 17. If a stone be thrown into stagnating water, the waves excited there by continue some time to arise in the place where the stone fell into the water, & are propagated from thence in concentric circles upon the surface of the water to great distances. And the vibrations or tremors excited in the Air by percussion continue a little time to move from the place of percussion in concentric spheres to great distances. And in like manner, when a Ray of light falls upon the surface of any pellucid body & is there refracted or reflected may not waves of vibrations or tremors be thereby excited in the refracting or reflecting Medium at the point of incidence & continue to arise there & to be propagated from thence as long as they continue when they are excited in the bottom of the eye by the pressure or motion of the finger or by the light which comes from the coale of fire in the experiments above mentioned? And are not these vibrations propagated from the point of incidence to great distances? And do they not overtake the rays of light, & by overtaking them successively do they not put them into the fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission described above? For if the rays endeavour to recede from the densest part of the vibration, they may be alternately accelerated & retarded by the vibrations overtaking them.
Qu. 18. If in two large tall cylindricall vessels of glass inverted, two little Thermometers be suspended so as not to touch the vessels, & the Aer be drawn out of one of these vessels, & these vessels thus prepared be carried out of a cold place into a warm one: the Thermometer in vacuo will grow warm as much & almost as soon as the Thermometer which is not in vacuo. And when the Vessels are carried back into the cold place, the Thermometer in vacuo will grow cold almost as soon as the other Thermometer. Is not the heat of the warm room conveyed through the Vacuum by the vibrations of a much subtiler Medium then Air, which after the Air was drawn out remained in the Vacuum? And is not this Medium the same with that Medium by which light is refracted & reflected, & by whose vibrations light communicates heat to bodies, & is put into fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission? And do not the vibrations of this Medium in hot bodies contribute to the intenseness & duration of their heat? And do not hot bodies communicate their heat to contiguous cold ones by the vibrations of this Medium propagated from them into the cold ones? And is not this Medium exceedingly more rare & subtile then the Air & exceedingly more elastick & active? And doth it not readily pervade all bodies? And is it not (by its elastic force) expanded through all the heavens?
Qu. 19. Doth not the refraction of light proceed from the different density of this æthereal Medium in different places, the light receding always from the denser parts of the Medium? And is not the density thereof greater in free & open spaces void of Air & other grosser bodies then within the pores of water glass crystal gemms & other compact bodies? For when light passes through glass or crystal & falling very obliquely upon the further surface thereof is totally reflected, the total reflexion ought to proceed rather from the density & vigour of the Medium without & beyond the glass, than from the rarity & weakness thereof.
Qu. 20. Doth not this æthereal Medium in passing out of water glass crystal & other compact & dense bodies into empty spaces grow denser <264r> & denser by degrees, & by that means refract the rays of light not in a point but by bending them gradually in curve lines? And doth not the gradual condensation of this Medium extend to some distance from the bodies & thereby cause the inflexions of the rays of light which pass by the edges of dense bodies at some distance from the bodies?
Qu. 21. Is not this Medium much rarer within the dense bodies of the Sun Stars Planets & Comets then in the empty celestial spaces between them, & in passing from them to great distances doth it not grow denser & denser perpetually & thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another, & of their parts towards the bodies; every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer? For if this Medium be rarer within the Sun's body then at its surface, & rarer there then at the hundredth part of an inch from its body, & rarer there then at the fiftith part of an inch from its body, & rarer there then at the Orb of Saturn: I see no reason why the increase of density should stop anywhere & not rather be continued through all distances from the Sun to Saturn & beyond. And tho this increase of density may at great distances be exceeding slow, yet if the elastick force of this Medium be exceeding great, it may suffice to impell bodies from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer with all that power which we call gravity. And that the elastick force of this Medium is exceeding great may be gathered from the swiftness of its vibrations. Sounds move about 1140 English feet in a second minute of time, & in seven or eight minutes of time they move about one hundred English miles. Light moves from the sun to us in about seven or eight minutes of time, which distance is about 70000000 English miles, supposing the horizontal Parallax of the Sun to be about 12″. And the vibrations or pulses of this Medium, that they may cause the alternate fits of easy transmission & easy reflexion, must be swifter then light, & by consequence above 700000 times swifter then sounds. And therefore the elastick force of this Medium in proportion to its density must be above 700000 x 700000 times greater then the elastick force of the Air is in proportion to its density. For 
‡ < insertion from f 263v > ‡ For the velocities of the pulses of elastic Mediums are in a subduplicate ratio of the elasticities & the rarities of the Mediums taken together.
As attraction is stronger in small magnets then in great ones in proportion to their bulk, & gravity is greater in the surfaces of small planets then in those of great ones in proportion ot their bulk, & small bodies are agitated much more by electric attraction then great ones: so the smallness of the rays of light may contribute very much to the power of the agent by which they are refracted. And so if any one should suppose that Ether (like our air) may contein particles which endeavour to recede from one another (for I do not know what this Æther is) & that its particles are exceedingly smaller then those of air, or even then those of light: the exceeding smallness of its particles may contribute to the greatness of the force by which those particles may recede from one another, & thereby make that Medium exceedingly more rare & elastic then Air, & by consequence exceedingly less able to resist the motions of projectiles & [exceedingly more able to press upon gross bodies by endeavouring to expand it self. < text from f 264r resumes > 
Qu. 22. May not Planets & Comets & all gross bodies perform their motions more freely & with much less resistance in this æthereal Medium then in any fluid which fills all space adequately without leaving any pores, & by consequence is much denser then quicksilver or gold? And may not its resistance be so small as to be inconsiderable? For instance. If this Æther (for so I will call it) should be supposed 700000 times more elastic then our Air & above 700000 times more rare; its resistance would be above 600000000 times less then that of water. And so small a resistance would scarce make any sensible alteration in the motions of the Planets in ten thousand years. If any one would ask how a Medium can be so rare; let him tell me how the Air in the upper parts of the Atmosphere can be above an hundred thousand thousand times rarer then Gold.
Qu. 23. Is not vision performed by the vibrations of this Medium excited in the bottom of the eye by the rays of light, & propagated through the solid pellucid & uniform capillamenta of the optick nerves into the place of sensation? And is not hearing performed by the vibrations either of this or some other Medium excited in the auditory nerves by the tremors of the Air, & propagated through the solid pellucid & uniform capilla <265r> menta of those nerves into the place of sensation? And so of the other senses.
Qu. 24. Is not animal motion performed by the vibrations of this Medium excited in the brain by the power of the will, & propagated from thence through the solid pellucid & uniform capillamenta of the nerves into the muscles for contracting & dilating them? I suppose that the vibrating motion of the ethereal Medium may be propagated along them from one end to the other uniformly & without interruption For obstructions in the Nerves create palsies. And that they may be sufficiently uniform I suppose them to be pellucid when viewed singly, tho the reflexions in their cylindrical surfaces may make the whole nerve (composed of many capillamenta) appear opake & white. For opacity arises from reflecting surfaces, such as may disturbe & interrupt the motions.
Qu. 25. Are there not other original properties of the rays of light besides those already described? An instance of another original property we have in the refraction of Island Crystal described first by Erasmus Bartholine & afterwards more exactly by Hugenius in his Book De la lumiere. This crystal is a pellucid fissile stone clear as water or crystal of the rock, & without colour; enduring a red heat without loosing it's transparency, & in a very strong heat calcining without fusion. Steeped a day or two in water it looses its natural polish. Being rubbed on cloth it attracts pieces of straws & other light things like Ambar or Glass: & with Aqua fortis it makes an ebullition. It seems to be a sort of Talk & is found in form of an oblique Parallelopiped [with six parallelogram sides & eight solid angles. The obtuse angles of the Parallelogramms are each of them 101 degrees & 52 minutes; the acute ones 78 degrees & 8 minutes. Two of the solid angles opposite to one another, as C & E, are compassed each of them with three of these obtuse angles, & each of the other six with one obtuse & two acute ones. It cleaves easily in planes parallel to any of its sides, & not in any other planes. It cleaves with a glossy polite surface not perfectly plane but with some little uneavenness. It is easily scratcht, & by reason of it's softness it takes a polish very difficultly. It polishes better upon polished looking-glass then upon metal, & perhaps better upon pitch leather or parchment. Afterwards it must be rubbed with a little oyle or white of an egg to fill up its scratches: whereby it will become very transparent & polite. But for several experiments, it is not necessary to polish it. If a piece of this crystalline stone be laid upon a book, every letter of the Book seen through it will appear double by means of a double refraction. And if any beam of light falls either perpendicularly or in any oblique angle upon any surface of this crystal, it becomes divided into two beams by means of the same double refraction. Which beams are of the same colour with the incident beam of light, & seem equal to one another in the quantity of their light, or very nearly equal. One of these refractions is performed by the usual Rule of Opticks, the sine of Incidence out of Air into this Crystal being to the sine of Refraction, as five to three. The other Refraction, which may be called the unusual Refraction, is performed by the following Rule.
Let ADBC represent the refracting surface of the crystall, C the biggest solid angle at that surface, GCHF the opposite surface, & CK a perpendicular on that surface. This perpendicular makes with the edge of the crystal CF an angle of 19degr. 3′. Ioyne KF & in it take KL so that the angle KCL be 6degr. 40′, & the angle LCF 12degr. 28′. And if ST represent any beam of light incident at T in any angle upon the refracting surface ADBC, let TV be the refracted <266r> beam determined by the given proportion of the sines 5 to 3 according to the usual rule of Opticks. Draw VX parallel & equal to KL. Draw it the same way from V in which L lieth from K; & joyning TX, this line TX shall be the other refracted beam carried from T to X by the unusual refraction.
If therefore the incident beam ST be perpendicular to the refracting surface, the two beams TV & TX into which it shall become divided, shall be parallel to the lines CK & CL; one of those beams going through the crystall perpendicularly as it ought to do by the usual laws of Opticks, & the other TX by an unusual refraction diverging from the perpendicular & making with it an angle VTX of about 6 degrees, as is found by experience. And hence the plane VTX & such like planes which are parallel to the plane CFK, may be called the planes of perpendicular refraction. And the coast towards which the lines KL & VX are drawn, may be called the coast of unusual refraction.
In like manner Crystal of the rock has a double refraction: but the difference of the two refractions is not so great & manifest as in Island crystall.
When the beam ST incident on Island Crystal, is divided into two beams TV & TX, & these two beams arrive at the further surface of the glass; the beam TV which was refracted at the first surface after the usual manner, shall be again refracted entirely after the usual manner at the second surface; & the beam TX which was refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface shall be again refracted entirely after the unusual manner in the second surface: so that both these beams shall emerge out of the second surface in lines parallel to the first incident beam ST.
And if two pieces of Island Crystall be placed one after another in such manner that all the surfaces of the latter be parallel to all the corresponding surfaces of the former: the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first surface of the first crystall shall be refracted after the usual manner in all the following surfaces: & the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface shall be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following surfaces. And the same thing happens tho the surfaces of the crystalls be any ways inclined to one another, provided that their planes of perpendicular refraction be parallel to one another.
And therefore there is an original difference in the rays of light by means of which some rays are in this Experiment constantly refracted after the usual manner, & others constantly after the unusual manner For if the difference be not original but arises from new modifications imprest on the rays at their first refraction it would be altered by new modifications in the three following refractions: whereas it suffers no alteration but is constant & has the same effect upon the rays in all the refractions. The unusual refraction is therefore performed by an original property of the rays. And it remains to be enquired whether the rays have not more original properties then are yet discovered.
Qu. 26. Have not the rays of light several sides endued with several original properties? For if the planes of perpendicular refraction of the second crystall, be at right angles with the planes of perpendicular refraction of the first crystall: the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in passing through the first crystall will be all of them refracted after the unusual manner in passing through the second crystall; & the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in passing through the first crystall will be all of them refracted after the usual manner in passing through the second crystall. And therefore there are not two sorts of rays differing in their nature from one another, one of which is constantly & in all positions refracted after the usual manner, & the other constantly & in all positions after the unusual <267r> manner. The difference between the two sorts of rays in the Experiment mentioned in the 25th Question, was only in the positions of the sides of the rays to the planes of perpendicular refraction. For one & the same ray is here refracted sometimes after the usual & sometimes after the unusual manner according to the position which its sides have to the crystalls. If the sides of the rays are posited the same way to both crystalls, it is refracted after the same manner in them both: but if that side of the ray which looks towards the coast of the unusual refraction of the first crystall be 90 degrees from that side of the same ray which looks towards the coast of the unusual refraction of the second crystall, (which may be effected by varying the position of the second crystall to the first, & by consequence to the rays of light the ray shall be refracted after several manners in the several crystalls. There is nothing more required to determin whether the rays of light which fall upon the second crystall shall be refracted after the usual or after the unusual manner, but to turn about this crystal so that the coast of this crystalls unusuall refraction may be on this or on that side of the ray. And therefore every ray may be considered as having four sides or quarters, two of which opposite to one another incline the ray to be refracted after the unusual manner as often as either of them are turned towards the coast of unusual refraction, & the other two whenever either of them are turned towards the coast of unusual refraction, do not incline it to be otherwise refracted then after the usual manner. The two first may therefore be called the sides of unusual refraction. And since these dispositions were in the rays before their incidence on the second third & fourth surfaces of the two crystalls, & suffered no alteration (so far as appears) by the refraction of the rays in their passage through those surfaces, & the rays were refracted by the same laws in all the four surfaces; it appears that those dispositions were in the rays originally, & suffered no alteration by the first refraction, & that by means of those dispositions the rays were refracted at their incidence on the first surface of the first crystal, some of them after the usual & some of them after the unusual manner, accordingly as their sides of unusual refraction were then turned towards the coast of the unusual refraction of that crystal or sideways from it.
Every ray of light has therefore two opposite sides originally endued with a property on which the unusual refraction depends, & other two opposite sides not endued with that property. And it remains to be enquired whether there are not more properties of light by which the sides of the rays differ & are distinguished from one another.
In explaining the difference of the sides of the rays above mentioned, I have supposed that the rays fall perpendicularly on the first crystall. But if they fall obliquely on it, the success is the same. Those rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first crystall will be refracted after the unusual manner in the second crystall; supposing the planes of perpendicular refraction to be at right angles with one another as above: & on the contrary.
If the planes of the perpendicular refraction of the two crystalls be neither parallel nor perpendicular to one another but contein an acute angle: the two beams of light which emerge out of the first crystall, will be each of them divided into two more at their incidence on the second crystall. For in this case the rays in each of the two beams will some of them have their sides of unusual refraction & some of them their other sides turned towards the coast of the unusual refraction of the second crystall.
Qu. 27. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous which have hitherto been invented for explaining the phenomena of light by new modi <268r> fications of the rays? For those phenomena depend not upon new modifications as has been supposed, but upon the original & unchangeable properties of the rays.
Qu. 28. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous in which light is supposed to consist in pression or motion propagated through a fluid Medium? For in all these Hypotheses the phænomena of light have been hitherto explained by supposing that they arise from new modifications of the rays: which is an erroneous supposition.
If light consisted only in pression propagated without actual motion it would not be able to agitate & heat the bodies which refract & reflect it. If it consisted in motion propagated to all distances in an instant it would require an infinite force every moment in every [shining particle to generate that motion. And if it consisted in pression or motion propagated either in an instant or in time it would bend into the shadow. For pression or motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines beyond an obstacle which stops part of the motion, but will bend & spread every way into the quiescent Medium which lyes beyond the obstacle. Gravity tends downwards, but the pressure of water arising from Gravity tends every way with equal force & is propagated as readily & with as much force sideways as downwards & through crooked passages as through streight ones. The waves on the surface of stagnating water, passing by the sides of a broad obstacle which stops part of them, bend afterwards & dilate themselves gradually into the quiet water behind the obstacle. The waves, pulses or vibrations of the Aer wherein sounds consist, bend manifestly tho not so much as the waves of water. For a Bell or a Canon may be heard beyond a hill which intercepts the sight of the sounding body, & sounds are propagated as readily through crooked pipes as through streight ones. But light is never known to follow crooked passages nor to bend into the shadow. For the fixt stars by the interposition of any of the Planets cease to be seen. And so do the parts of the Sun by the interposition of the Moon, Mercury or Venus. The rays which pass very neare to the edges of any body are bent a little by the action of the body, as we shewed above, but this bending is not towards but from the shadow, & is performed only in the passage of the ray by the body & at a very small distance from it. So soon as the ray is past the body, it goes right on.
To explain the unusual refraction of Island Crystal by pression or motion propagated has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge) except by Huygens who for that end supposed two several vibrating Mediums within that Crystall. But when he tryed the refractions in two successive pieces of that crystall, & found them such as is mentioned above: he confessed himself at a loss for explaining them. For pressions or motions propagated from a shining body through an uniform Medium must be on all sides alike: whereas by those experiments it appears that the rays of light have different properties in their different sides. He suspected that the pulses of Æther in passing through the first crystall might receive certain new modifications which might determin them to be propagated in this or that Medium within the second crystal according to the position of that crystall. [1] But what modifications those might be he could not say, nor think of any thing satisfactory in that point. And if he had known that the unusual refraction depends not on new modifications but on the original & unchangeable dispositions of the rays, he would have found it as difficult to explain how those dispositions which he supposed to be imprest on the rays by the first crystall, could be in them before their incidence on that crystall; & in general, how all rays emitted by shining bodies, can have those dispositions in them from the beginning. To me at least this seems inexplicable if light be nothing else then pression or motion propagated through Æther. 
<269r>
And it is as difficult to explain by these Hypotheses how rays can be alternately in fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission; unless perhaps one might suppose that there are in all space two ethereal vibrating Mediums, & that the vibrations of one of them constitute light, & the vibrations of the other are swifter, & as often as they overtake the vibrations of the first, put them into those fits. But how two æthers can be diffused through all space, one of which acts upon the other & by consequence is reacted upon, without retarding shattering dispersing & confounding one anothers motions is inconceivable. And against filling the heavens with fluid Mediums unless they be exceeding rare, a great objection arises from the regular & very lasting motions of the Planets & Comets in all manner of courses through the heavens. For thence it is manifest that the heavens are voyd of all sensible resistance & by consequence of all sensible matter.
For the resisting power of fluid Mediums arises partly from the attrition of the parts of the Medium & partly from the vis inertiæ of the matter. That part of the resistance of a spherical body which arises from the attrition of the parts of the Medium is very nearely as the diameter, or, at the most, as the factum of the diameter & the velocity of the spherical body together. And that part of the resistance which arises from the vis inertiæ of the matter is as the square of that factum. And by this difference the two sorts of resistance may be distinguished from one another in any Medium; & these being distinguished, it will be found that almost all the resistance of bodies of a competent magnitude moving in Aer, Water, Quicksilver, & such like fluids with a competent velocity, arises from the Vis Inertiæ of the parts of the fluid
Now that part of the resisting power of any Medium which arises from the tenacity friction or attrition of the parts of the Medium may be diminished by dividing the matter into smaller parts & making the parts more smooth & slipery: but that part of the resistance which arises from the vis inertiæ, is proportional to the density of the matter & cannot be diminished by dividing the matter into smaller parts nor by any other means then by decreasing the density of the Medium. And for these reasons the density of fluid Mediums is very nearely proportional to their resistance. Liquors which differ not much in density as water, spirit of wine, spirit of Turpentine, hot oyle, differ not much in resistance. Water is thirteen or fourteen times lighter then Quicksilver, & by consequence thirteen or fourteen times rarer, & its resistance is less then that of quicksilver in the same proportion or thereabouts, as I have found by experiments made with Pendulums. The open Air in which we breath is eight or nine hundred times lighter then water & by consequence eight or nine hundred times rarer, & accordingly its resistance is less then that of water in the same proportion or thereabouts; as I have also found by experiments made with Pendulums. And in thinner Air the resistance is sitll less, & at length, by rarefying the Air, becomes insensible. For small feathers falling in the open Air meet with great resistance, but in a tall glass well emptied of Air they fall as fast as lead or gold, as I have seen tried several times. Whence the resistance seems still to decrease in proportion to the density of the fluid. For I do not find by any experiments that bodies moving in Quicksilver, Water or Air, meet with any other sensible resistance then what arises from the density & tenacity of those sensible fluids, as they would do if the pores of those fluids & all other spaces were filled with a dense & subtile fluid. Now if the resistance in a vessel well emptied of Air, was but an hundred times less then in the open Air, it would be about a million of times less then in quicksilver. But it seems to be much less in such a vessel, & still much less in the heavens at the height of three or four hundred miles from the earth or above. For Mr Boyle has shewed that Air may be rarefied above ten thousand times in vessels of glass: & the heavens are much <270r> emptier of Air then any vacuum we can make below. For since the Air is comprest by the weight of the incumbent atmosphere, & the density of Air is proportional to the force compressing it, it follows by computation that at the height of about seven English miles from the Earth the aer is four times rarer then at the surface of the Earth, & at the height of 14 miles it is sixteen times rarer then at the surface of the earth, & at the height of 21, 28, or 35 miles it is respectively 64, 256 or 1024 times rarer or thereabouts; & at the height of 70, 140 or 210 miles it is about 1000000, 1000000000000 or 1000000000000000000 times rarer; & so on.
Heat promotes fluidity very much by diminishing the tenacity of bodies. It makes many bodies fluid which are not fluid in cold, & increases the fluidity of tenacious liquids as of Oyle Balsam & Honey, & thereby decreases their resistance. But it decreases not the resistance of water considerably as it would do if any considerable part of the resistance of water arose from the attrition or tenacity of its parts. And therefore the resistance of water arises principally & almost entirely from the Vis inertiæ of its matter; & by consequence, if the heavens were as dense as water they would not have much less resistance then water; if as dense as quicksilver they would not have much less resistance then quicksilver; if absolutely dense or full of matter without any vacuum, let the matter be never so subtile & fluid, they would have a greater resistance then quicksilver. A solid globe in such a Medium would lose above half its motion in moving three times the length of its diameter, & a globe not solid (such as are the Planets) would be retarded sooner. And therefore to make way for the regular & lasting motions of the Planets & Comets, its necessary to empty the heavens of all matter, except perhaps some very thin vapors steams or effluvia arising from the Atmospheres of the Earth, Planets & Comets, & such an exceedingly rare æthereal Medium as we described above. A dense fluid can be of no use for explaining the Phænomena of nature, the motions of the Planets & Comets being better explained without it. It serves only to disturb & retard the motions of those great bodies & make the frame of nature languish: & in the pores of bodies, it serves only stop the vibrating motions of their parts wherein their heat & activity consists. And as it is of no use & hinders the operations of nature & makes her languish, so there is no evidence for its existence, & therefore it ought to be rejected. And if it be rejected, the Hypotheses that light consists in pression or motion propagated through such a Medium, are rejected with it.
And for rejecting such a Medium we have the authority of those the oldest & most celebrated Philosophers of Greece & Phenicia who made a Vacuum & Atoms & the gravity of Atoms the first Principles of their Philosophy; tacitely attributing gravity to some other cause then dense matter. Later Philosophers banish the consideration of such a cause out of Natural Philosophy, feigning Hypotheses for explaining all things mechanically & referring other causes to Metaphysicks: whereas the main business of natural Philosophy is to argue from Phænomena without feigning Hypotheses, & to deduce causes from effects till we come to the very first cause, which certainly is not mechanical; & not only to unfold the mechanism of the world but chiefly to resolve these & such like questions. What is there in places almost empty of matter, & whence is it that the Sun & Planets gravitate towards one another without dense matter between them? Whence is it that Nature doth nothing in vain, & whence arises all that order & beauty which we see in the world? To what end are Comets, & whence is it that Planets move all one & the same way in Orbs concentric, while Comets move all manner of ways in Orbs very excentric, & what hinders the fixt stars from falling upon one another? How came the bodies of animals to be contrived with so much art, & for what ends were there several parts? Was the eye contrived without skill in Opticks, & the ear without knowledge of sounds? How do the motions of the body follow from the will, & <271r> whence is the instinct in animals? Is not the sensory of animals that place to which the sensitive substance is present, & into which the sensible species of things are carried through the nerves & brain that there they may be perceived by their immediate presence to that substance? And these things being rightly dispatcht, does it not appear from phænomena that there is a Being incorporeal, living, intelligent, omnipresent, who in infinite space, as it were in his sensory, sees the things themselves intimately, & throughly perceives them & comprehends them wholy by their immediate presence to himself: of which things the images only carried through the organs of sense into our little sensoriums, are there seen & beheld by that which in us perceives & thinks. And tho every true step made in this Philosophy brings us not immediately to the knowledge of the first cause, yet it brings us nearer to it, & on that account is to be highly valued.
Qu. 29. Are not the rays of light very small bodies emitted from shining substances? For such bodies will pass through uniform mediums in right lines without bending into the shadow, which is the nature of the rays of light. They will also be capable of several properties & be able to conserve their properties unchanged in passing through several Mediums, which is another condition of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon the rays of light at a distance in refracting reflecting & inflecting them, & the rays mutually agitate the parts of those substance at a distance for heating them; & this action & reaction at a distance very much resembles an attractive force between bodies. if refraction be performed by attraction of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction in a given proportion, as we shewed in our Principles of Philosophy; & this Rule is true by experience. The rays of light in going out of glass into a Vacuum, are bent towards the glass, & if they fall too obliquely on the vacuum they are bent backwards into the glass & totaly reflected; & this reflexion cannot be ascribed to the resistance of an absolute Vacuum, but must be caused by the power of the glass attracting the rays at their going out of it into the Vacuum & bringing them back. For if the further surface of the glass be moistened with water or clear oyle or liquid & clear honey: the rays which would otherwise be reflected will go into the water oyle or honey, & therefore are not reflected before they arrive at the further surface of the glass & begin to go out of it. If they go out of it into the water oyle or honey, they go on, because the attraction of the glass is almost ballanced & rendred ineffectual by the contrary attraction of the liquor. But if they go out of it into a Vacuum which has no attraction to ballance that of the glass, the attraction of the glass either bends & refracts them, or brings them back & reflects them. And this is still more evident by laying together two Prisms of glass, or two Object-glasses of very long Telescopes, the one plane the other a little convex, & so compressing them that they do not fully touch nor are too far asunder. For the light which falls upon the further surface of the first glass where the interval between the glasses is not above the ten [hundred thousandth part of an inch, will go through that surface, & through the air or vacuum between the glasses, & enter into the second glass, as was explained in the first fourth & eighth Observations of the first Part of the second Book. But if the second glass be taken away, the light which goes out of the second surface of the first glass into the Air or Vacuum, will not go on forwards but turns back into the first glass & is reflected; & therefore it is drawn back by the power of the first glass, there being nothing else to turn it back. Nothing more is requisite for the producing all the variety of colours & degrees of refrangibility then that the rays of light be bodies of different sizes, the least of which may make violet the weakest & darkest of the colours, & be <272r> more easily diverted by refracting surfaces from the right course; & the rest as they are bigger & bigger, may make the stronger & more lucid colours, blue, green, yellow, & red, & be more & more difficultly diverted. Nothing more is requisite for putting the rays of light into fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission, then that they be small bodies which by their attractive powers or some other force, stir up vibrations in what they act upon, which vibrations being swifter then the rays, overtake them successively, & agitate them so as by turns to increase & decrease their velocities & thereby put them into those fits. And lastly the unusual refraction of Island Crystal looks very much as if it were performed by some kind of attractive vertue lodged in certain sides both of the rays & of the particles of the crystal. For were it not for some kind of disposition or vertue lodged in some sides of the particles of the crystall & not in their other sides, & which inclines & bends the rays towards the coast of unusual refraction; the rays which fall perpendicularly on the crystall, would not be refracted towards that coast rather then towards any other coast, both at their incidence & at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by a contrary situation of the coast of unusual refraction at the second surface; the crystall acting upon the rays after they have past through it & are emerging into the Air, or, if you please, into a Vacuum. And since the crystall by this disposition or vertue does not act upon the rays unless when one of their sides of unusual refraction looks towards that coast, this argues a vertue or disposition in those sides of the rays, which answers to & sympathizes with that vertue or disposition of the crystall as the poles of two magnets answer to one another. And as magnetism may be intended & remitted, & is found only in the Magnet & in iron: so this vertue of refracting the perpendicular rays is greater in Island Crystall, less in Crystall of the rock, & is not yet found in other bodies. I do not say that this vertue is magnetical. It seems to be of another kind. I only say that what ever it be, it's difficult to conceive how the rays of light unless they be bodies, can have a permanent vertue in two of their sides which is not in their other sides, & this without any regard to their position to the space or Medium through which they pass.
What I mean in this Question by a Vacuum & by the attractions of the rays of light towards glass or crystall may be understood by what was said in the 18th 19th & 20th Questions.
Qu. 30. Are not gross bodies & light convertible into one another, & may not bodies receive much of their activity from the particles of light which enter their composition? For all fixt bodies being heated emit light so long as they continue sufficiently hot, & light mutually stops in bodies as often as its rays strike upon their parts, as we shewed above. I know no body less apt to shine then water; & yet water by frequent destillations changes into fixed earth, as Mr Boyle has tried, & then this earth being enabled to endure a sufficient heat, shines by heat like other bodies.
The changing of bodies into light & light into bodies is very conformable to the course of nature, which seems delighted with transmutations. Water which is a very fluid volatile tastless salt, she changes by heat into vapour which is a sort of air, & by cold into ice which is a hard pellucid brittle fusible stone: & this stone returns into water by heat & vapour returns into water by cold. Earth by heat becomes fire & by cold returns into earth. Dense bodies by fermentation rarefy into several sorts of air, & this air by fermentation & sometimes without it; returns into dense [bodies. Mercury appears sometimes in the form of a fluid metall, sometimes in the form of a hard brittle metall; sometimes in the form of a corrosive pellucid salt called sublimate, sometimes in the form of a tastless pellucid volatile white earth called <273r> Mercurius dulcis, or in that of a red opake volatile earth called Cinnaber, or in that of a red or white Precipitate, or in that of a fluid salt; & in destillation it turns into vapour, & beign agitated in Vacuo it shines like fire. And after all these changes it returns again into its first form of Mercury. Eggs grow from insensible magnitudes & change into animals, Tadpoles into Froggs, & Worms into flyes. All Birds Beasts & Fishes, Insects Trees & other Vegetables with their several parts, grow out of water & watry tinctures & salts, & by putrefaction return again into watry substances. And water standing a few days in the open air, yeilds a tincture, which (like that of Mault) by standing longer yeilds a sediment & a spirit, but before putrefaction is fit nourishment for animals & vegetables. And among such various & strange transmutations, why may not nature change bodies into light & light into bodies?
Qu. 31. Have not the small particles of bodies certain powers virtues or forces by which they act at a distance, not only upon the rays of light for reflecting refracting & inflecting them, but also upon one another for producing a great part of the phænomena of nature? For its well known that bodies act one upon another by the attractions of gravity magnetism & electricity, & these instances shew the tenour & course of nature, & make it not improbable but that there may be more attractive powers then these. For Nature is very consonant & conformable to her self. How these attractions may be performed I do not here consider. What I call attraction may be performed by impulse or by some other means unknown to me. I use that word here to signify only in general any force by which bodies tend towards one another whatsoever be the cause. For we must learn from the phænomena of nature what bodies attract one another, & what are the laws & properties of the attraction, before we enquire the cause by which the attraction is performed. The attractions of gravity magnetism & electricity reach to very sensible distances, & so have been observed by vulgar eyes, & there may be others which reach to so small distances as hitherto escape observation, & perhaps electrical attraction may reach to such small distances even without being excited by friction.
For when salt of Tartar runs per deliquium, is not this done by an attraction between the particles of the salt of Tartar & the particles of the water which float in the Aer in the form of vapors? And why does not common salt or saltpeter or vitriol run per deliquium but for want of such an attraction? Or why does not salt of Tartar draw more water out of the Air then in a certain proportion to its quantity, but for want of an attractive force after it is satiated with water? And whence is it but from this attractive power that water which alone distills with a gentle lukewarm heat will not destill from salt of Tartar without a great heat? And is it not from the like attractive power between the particles of oyle of Vitriol & the particles of water, that Oyle of Vitriol draws to it a good quantity of water out of the Air, & after it is satiated draws no more, & in destillation lets go the water very difficultly? And when water & oyle of Vitriol poured sucessively into the same vessel grow very hot in the mixing, does not this heat argue a great motion in the parts of the liquors? And does not this motion argue that the parts of the two liquors in mixing coaless with violence & by consequence rush towards one another with an accelerated motion? And when Aqua fortis or spirit of Vitriol poured upon filings of iron dissolves the filings with a great heat & ebullition, is not this heat & ebullition effected by a violent motion of <274r> the parts, & does not that motion argue that the acid parts of the liquor rush towards the parts of the metall with violence, & run forcibly into its pores till they get between its outmost particles & the main mass of the metall, & surrounding those particles loosen them from the main mass & set them at liberty to flote off into the water? And when the acid particles which alone would destill with an easy heat will not separate from the particles of the metall without a very vio[lent heat, does not this confirm the attraction between them?
When spirit of Vitriol poured upon common salt or saltpeter makes an ebullition with the salt & unites with it, & in destillation the spirit of the common salt or saltpeter comes over much easier then it would do before, & the acid part of the spirit of Vitriol stays behind; does not this argue that the fixed Alcaly of the salt attracts the acid spirit of the Vitriol more strongly then its own spirit, & not being able to hold them both, lets go its own? And when oyle of Vitriol is drawn off from its weight of Nitre, & from both the ingredients a compound spirit of Nitre is destilled, two parts of which being poured on one part of oyle of cloves or Carvy seeds, or of any ponderous vegetable oyle, or oyle of animal substances, or oyle of Turpentine thickened with a little Balsam of sulphur, grows so very hot in mixing as presently to send up a burning flame: does not this very great & sudden heat argue that the two liquors mix with violence, & that their parts in mixing run towards one another with an accelerated motion, & clash with the greatest force? And is it not for the same reason that well rectified spirit of wine poured on the same compound spirit flashes, & that the pulvis fulminans composed of sulphur Nitre & salt of Tartar, goes off with a more sudden & violent explosion then Gun-powder, the acid spirits of the sulphur & nitre rushing towards one another & towards the salt of Tartar with so great a violence, as by the shock to turn the whole at once into vapour & flame? Where the dissolution is slow it makes a slow ebullition & a gentle heat, & where it is quicker it makes a greater ebullition with more heat, & where it is done at once the ebullition is contracted into a sudden blast or violent explosion with a heat equal to that of fire & flame. So when a drachm of the above-mentioned compound spirit of Nitre was poured upon half a drachm of oyle of Carvi sees in vacuo, the mixture immediately made a flash like gunpowder & burst the exhausted Receiver, which was a glass six inches wide and eight inches deep. And even the gross body of sulphur poudered, & with an equal weight of iron filings & a little water made into past, acts upon the iron, & in five or six hours grows too hot to be touched, & emits a flame. And by these experiments compared with the great quantity of Sulphur with which the Earth abounds, & the warmth of the interior parts of the earth & hot springs & burning mountains & with damps, mineral corruscations, earthquakes, hot suffocating exhalations, hurricanes & spouts: we may learn that sulphureous steams abound in the bowells of the earth & ferment with mineralls, & sometimes take fire with a sudden corruscation & explosion, & if pent up in subterraneous caverns, burst the caverns with a great shaking of the earth as in springing of a Mine. And then the vapour generated by the explosion, expiring through the pores of the earth, feels hot & suffocates & makes tempests & hurricanes, & sometimes causes the land to slide, or the sea to boyle, & carries up the water thereof in drops which by their weight fall down again in spouts. Also some sulphureous steams, at all times when the earth is dry, ascending into the Air, ferment there with nitrous acids, & sometimes taking fire cause lightning & thunder & fiery meteors. For the Air abounds with acid vapours fit <275r> to promote fermentations, as appears by the rusting of iron and copper in it, the kindling of fire by blowing, & the beating of the heart by means of respiration. Now the above mentioned motions are so great & violent as to shew that in fermentations, the particles of bodies which almost rest are put into new motions by a very potent principle which acts upon them only when they approach one another, & causes them to meet & clash with great violence, & grow hot with the motion, & dash one another into pieces, & vanish into air & vapour & flame.
When salt of Tartar per deliquium, being poured into the solution of any metal, precipitates the metall, & makes it fall down to the bottom of the liquor in the form of mud: does not this argue that the acid particles are attracted more strongly by the salt of Tartar then by the metall, & by the stronger attraction go from the metal to the salt of Tartar? And so when a solution of iron in Aqua fortis dissolves the Lapis Calaminaris & lets go the iron, or a solution of Copper dissolves iron immersed in it & lets go the copper, or a solution of silver dissolves copper & lets go the silver, or a solution of Mercury in Aqua fortis being poured upon Iron Copper Tin or Lead, dissolves the metall & lets go the Mercury, does not this argue that the acid particles of the Aqua fortis are attracted more strongly by the Lapis Calaminaris then by Iron, & more strongly by iron then by copper, & more strongly by Copper then by silver, & more strongly by Iron Copper Tin & Lead then by Mercury? And is it not for the same reason that iron requires more Aqua fortis to dissolve it then Copper, & Copper more then the other metalls; & that of all metalls, Iron is dissolved most easily, & is most apt to rust; & next after Iron, Copper?
When Oyle of Vitriol is mixed with a little water, or is run per deliquium, & in destillation the water ascends difficultly, & brings over with it some part of the oyle of Vitriol in the form of spirit of Vitriol, & this spirit upon being poured upon iron copper or salt of Tartar unites with the body & lets go the water, doth not this shew that the acid spirit is attracted by the water, & more attracted by the fixt body then by the water, & therefore lets go the water to close with the fixt body? And is it not for the same reason that the water & acid spirits which are mixed together in Vinegar, Aqua fortis, & spirit of salt, cohere & rise together in destillation; but if the Menstruum be poured on salt of Tartar, or on Lead or Iron or any fixt body which it can dissolve, the acid by a stronger attraction adheres to the body & lets go the water? And is it not also from a mutual attraction that the spirits of soot & sea-salt unite & compose the particles of Salarmoniac, which are less volatile then before because grosser & freer from water; & that the particles of Salarmoniac in sublimation carry up the particles of Antimony which will not sublime alone; & that the particles of Mercury uniting with the acid particles of spirit of salt compose Mercury sublimate, & with the particles of Sulphur compose cinnaber; & that the particles of spirit of wine & spirit of urin well rectified unite, & letting go the water which dissolved them compose a consistent body; & that in subliming cinnaber from salt of Tartar or from quick lime, the sulphur by a stronger attraction of the salt or lime lets go the Mercury & stays with the fixt body; & that when Mercury sublimate is sublimed from Antimony or from Regulus of Antimony, the spirit of salt lets go the Mercury, & unites with the Antimonial metall which attracts it more strongly, & stays with it till the heat be great enough to make them both ascend together, & then carries up the metall with it in the form of a very fusible salt called Butter of Antimony, although the spirit of salt alone be almost as volatile as water, & the Antimony alone as fixt as Lead?
<276r>
When Aqua fortis dissolves silver & not gold, & Aqua regia dissolves gold & not silver; may it not be said that Aqua fortis is subtile enough to penetrate gold as well as silver, but wants the attractive force to give it entrance, & that Aqua regia is subtile enough to penetrate silver as well as gold, but wants the attractive force to give it entrance? For Aqua regia is nothing else then Aqua fortis mixed with some spirit of salt or with Salarmoniac; & even common salt dissolved in Aqua fortis enables the Menstruum to dissolve gold tho the salt be a gross body. When therefore spirit of salt precipitates silver out of Aqua fortis, is it not done by attracting & mixing with the Aqua fortis, & not attracting or perhaps repelling silver? And when water precipitates Antimony out of the sublimate of Antimony & Salarmoniac, or out of butter of Antimony, is it not done by its dissolving, mixing with & weakening the Salarmoniac or spirit of salt & its not attracting or perhaps repelling the Antimony? And is it not for want of an attractive vertue between the parts of water & oyle, of Quicksilver & Antimony, of Lead & Iron, that these substances do not mix; and by a weak attraction that Quicksilver & Copper mix difficultly; & from a strong one that Quicksilver & Tin, Antimony & Iron, water & salts mix readily? And in general, is it not from the same principle that heat congregates homogeneal bodies & separates heterogeneal ones?
When Arsnick with soap gives a Regulus & with Mercury sublimate a volatile fusible salt like butter of Antimony; doth not this shew that Arsnick, which is a substance totally volatile, is compounded of fixt & volatile parts strongly cohering by a mutual attraction so that the volatile will not ascend without carrying up the fixed? And so, when an equal weight of spirit of wine & oyle of vitriol are digested together, & in destillation yeild two fragrant volatile spirits which will not mix with one another, & a fixt black earth remains behind; doth not this shew that oyle of Vitriol is composed of volatile & fixed parts strongly united by attraction so as to ascend together in form of a volatile acid fluid salt, untill the spirit of wine attracts & separates the volatile parts from the fixed? And therefore since oyle of sulphur per campanam is of the same nature with oyle of Vitriol; may it not be inferred that Sulphur is also a mixture of volatile & fixed parts so strongly cohering by attraction as to ascend together in sublimation. By dissolving flowers of sulphur in oyle of Turpentine & destilling the solution, it is found that Sulphur is composed of an inflamable thick oyle or fat bitumen, an acid salt, a very fixed earth & a little metall. The three first were found not much unequall to one another, the fourth in so small a quantity as scarce to be worth considering. The acid salt dissolved in water is the same with Oyle of Sulphur per Campanam, & abounding much in the bowells of the earth & particularly in Markasites, unites it self to the other ingredients of the Markasite, which are, Bitumen, Iron, Copper & Earth, & with them compounds Alume, Vitriol, & Sulphur. With the earth alone it compounds Alume; with the Metall alone or Metal & earth together it compounds Vitriol; & with the Bitumen & Earth it compounds Sulphur. Whence it comes to pass that Marcasites abound with those three Mineralls. And is it not from the mutual attraction of the ingredients that they stick together for compounding these mineralls, & that the Bitumen carries up the other ingredients of the sulphur, which without it would not sublime? And the same Question may be put concerning all or almost all the gross bodies in nature. For all the parts of animals & vegetables are composed of substances volatile & fixed, fluid & solid, as appears by their Analysis; & so are salts & minerals so far as Chymists have been hitherto able to examin their composition.
<277r>
When Mercury sublimate is resublimed with fresh Mercury & becomes Mercurius dulcis, which is a white tastless earth scarce dissolvable in water, and Mercurius dulcis resublimed with spirit of salt returns into Mercury sublimate; & when Metalls corroded with a little acid turn into rust, which is an earth tastless & indissolvable in water, & this earth imbibed with more acid becomes a metallic salt; & when some stones, as Spar of Lead, dissolved in proper menstruums become salts; do not these things shew that salts are dry earth, & watry acid united by attraction, & that the earth will not become a salt without so much acid as makes it dissolvable in water? Do not the sharp & pungent tasts of acids arise from the strong attraction whereby the acid particles rush upon & agitate the particles of the tongue? And when metalls are dissolved in acid menstruums, & the acids in conjunction with the metall act after a different manner so that the compound has a different tast much milder then before, & sometimes a sweet one; is it not because the acids adhere to the metallic particles, & thereby, lose much of their activity? And if the acid be in too small a proportion to make the compound dissolvable in water, will it not by adhering strongly to the metall become unactive & lose its tast, & the compound be a tastless earth? For such things as are not dissolvable by the moisture of the tongue, act not upon the tast.
As gravity makes the sea flow round the denser & weightier parts of the globe of the earth; so the attraction may make the watry acid flow round the denser & compacter particles of earth for composing the particles of salt. For otherwise the acid would not do the office of a medium between the earth & common water for making salts dissolvable in the water: nor would salt of Tartar readily draw off the acid from dissolved metalls; nor metalls the acid from Mercury. Now as in the great globe of the earth & sea, the densest bodies by their gravity sink down in water, & always endeavour to go towards the center of the globe; so in particles of salt the densest matter may always endeavour to approach the center of the particle: so that a particle of salt may be compared to a chaos, being dense hard dry & earthy in the centre, & rare, soft, moist, & watry in the circumference. And hence it seems to be that salts are of a lasting nature, being scarce destroyed unless by drawing away their watry parts by violence or by letting them soak into the pores of the central earth by a gentle heat in putrefaction, untill the earth be dissolved by the water, & separated into smaller particles, which by reason of their smallness make the rotten compound appear of a black colour. Hence also it may be that the parts of animals & vegetables preserve their several forms & assimilate their nourishment; the soft & moist nourishment easily changing its texture by a gentle heat & motion, till it becomes like the dense hard dry & durable earth in the centre of each particle. But when the nourishment grows unfit to be assimilated, or the central earth grows too feeble to assimilate it, the motion ends in confusion, putrefaction, & death.
If a very small quantity of any salt or Vitriol be dissolved in a great quantity of water, the particles of the salt or vitriol will not sink to the bottom, tho they be heavier in specie then the water, but will eavenly diffuse themselves into all the water, so as to make it as saline at the top as at the bottom. And does not this imply that the parts of the salt or Vitriol recede from one another, & endeavour to expand themselves, & get as far asunder as the quantity of water in which they float, will allow?
<278r>
And does not this endeavour imply that they have a repulsive force by which they fly from one another, or at least that they attract the water more strongly then they do one another? For as all things ascend in water which are less attracted then water by the gravitating power of the earth: so all the particles of salt which float in water & are less attracted then water by any one particle of salt, must recede from that particle & give way to the more attracted water.
When any saline liquor is evaporated to a cuticle & let cool, the salt concretes in regular figures, which argues that the particles of the salt before they concreted, floated in the liquor at equal distances in rank & file, & by consequence that they acted upon one another by some power which at equal distances is equal, at unequal distances unequal. For by such a power they will range themselves uniformly, & without it they will float irregularly & come together as irregularly. And since the particles of Island Crystall act all the same way upon the rays of light for causing the unusual refraction, may it not be supposed that in the formation of this crystall, the particles not only ranged themselves in rank & file for concreting in regular figures, but also by some kind of polar vertue turned their homogeneal sides the same way.
The parts of all homogeneal hard bodies which fully touch one another stick together very strongly. And for explaining how this may be some have invented hooked atoms, which is begging the question; & others tell us that bodies are glued together by rest, that is, by an Occult Quality, or rather by nothing; & others that they stick together by conspiring motions, that is, by relative rest amongst themselves. I had rather inferr from their cohesion, that their particles attract one another by some force, which in immediate contact is exceeding strong, at small distances performs the chymical operations above mentioned, & reaches not far from the particles with any sensible effect.
All bodies seem to be composed of hard particles: For otherwise fluids would not congeale, as water, oyles, vinegre, & spirit or oyle of Vitriol do by freezing, Mercury by fumes of Lead, spirit of Nitre & Mercury by dissolving the Mercury & evaporating the flegm, spirit of Wine & spirit of Urin by deflegming & mixing them, & spirit of urine & spirit of salt by subliming them together to make Salarmoniac. Even the rays of light seem to be hard bodies: for otherwise they would not retain different properties in their different sides. And therefore hardness may be recconed the property of all uncompounded matter. At least this seems to be as evident as the universal impenetrability of matter. For all bodies so far as experience reaches, are either hard or may be hardned, & we have no other evidence of universal impenetrability besides a large experience without an experimental exception. Now if compound bodies are so very hard as we find some of them to be, & yet are very porous, & consist of parts which are only laid together: the simple particles which are void of pores & were never yet divided, must be much harder. For such hard particles being heaped up together, can scarce touch one another in more then a few points, & therefore must be separable by much less force then is requisite to break a solid particle, whose parts touch in all the space between them without any pores or interstices to weaken their cohesion. And how such very hard particles which are only laid together & touch only in a few points, can stick together, & that so firmly as they do, without the assistance of something which causes them to be attracted or prest towards one another, is very difficult to conceive.
The same thing I inferr also from the cohering of two polished Marbles in Vacuo, & from the standing of Quicksilver in the Barometer at the height <279r> of 50, 60 or 70 inches or above, when ever it is well purged of air & carefully poured in, so that its parts be every where contiguous, both to one another & to the glass. The Atmosphere by its weight presses the Quicksilver ‡ < insertion from the top of f 279v > ‡ into the glass to the height of 29 or 30 inches. And some other Agent raises it higher, not by pressing it into the glass but by making its parts stick to the glass & to one another. For upon any discontinuation of parts made either by bubbles or by shaking the glass, the whole Mercury falls down to the height of 29 or 30 inches. < text from f 279r resumes > 
And of the same kind with these experiments are those that follow. If two plane polished plates of glass (suppose two pieces of a polished looking-glass) be laid together so that their sides be parallel & at a very small distance from one another, & then their lower edges be dipped into water; the water will rise up between them. And the less the distance of the glasses is, the greater will be the height to which the water will rise. If the distance be about the hundredth part of an inch, the water will rise to the height of about an inch; & if the distance be greater or less in any proportion, the height will be reciprocally proportional to the distance very nearly. For the attractive force of the glasses is the same whether the distance between them be greater or less; & the weight of the water drawn up, is the same, if the height, of it be reciprocally proportional to the distance of the glasses. And in like manner, water ascends between two Marbles polished plane, when their polished sides are parallel, & at a very little distance from one another. And if slender pipes of glass be dipped at one end into stagnating water, the water will rise up within the pipe, & the height to which it rises will be reciprocally proportional to the diameter of the cavity of the pipe, & will equal the height to which it rises between two planes of glass, if the semidiameter of the cavity of the Pipe be equal to the distance between the planes, or thereabouts. And these Experiments succeed after the same manner in Vacuo as in the open Aer, & therefore are not influenced by the weight or pressure of the Atmosphere.
And if a large Pipe of glass be filled with sifted ashes well pressed together in the glass, & one end of the Pipe be dipped into stagnating water: the water will rise up slowly in the ashes so as in the space of a week or fortnight to reach up within the glass to the height of 30 or 40 inches above the stagnating water. And the water rises up to this height by the attraction only of those particles of the ashes which are upon the surface of the elevated water; the particles which are within the water, attracting it as much downwards as upwards. And therefore the attraction of the particles is very strong. But the particles of the ashes being not so dense & close together as those of glass their attraction is not so strong as that of glass which keeps Quicksilver suspended to the height of 60 or 70 inches & therefore attracts with a force which would keep water suspended to the height of above fifty feet.
By the same principle, a Sponge sucks in water, & the Glands in the bodies of animals, according to their several natures & dispositions, suck in various juices from the blood.
If two plane polished plates of glass three or four inches broad & twenty or twenty five long, be laid, one of them parallel to the horizon, the other upon the first so as at one of their ends to touch one another & contein an Angle of about 10 or 15 minutes, & the same be first moistened on their inward sides with a clear cloth dipt into oyle of Oranges or spirit of Turpentine, & a drop or two of the Oyle or Spirit be let fall upon the lower glass at the other end: so soon as the upper glass is laid down upon the lower so as to touch it at one end as above, & to touch the drop at the other end, making with the lower glass an angle of about 10 or 15 minutes; the drop will begin to move towards the concourse of the glasses, & will continue to move with an <280r> accelerated motion till it arrives at that concourse of the glasses. For the two glasses attract the drop & make it run that way towards which the attractions incline. And if when the drop is in motion you lift up that end of the glasses where they meet & towards which the drop moves: the drop will ascend between the glasses & therefore is attracted. And as you lift up the glasses more & more the drop will ascend slower & slower & at length rest being then carried downward by its weight as much as upwards by the attraction. And by this means you may know the force by which the drop is attracted at all distances from the concourse of the glasses.
Now by some experiments of this kind it has been found that the attraction is almost reciprocally in a duplicate proportion of the distance of the middle of the drop from the concourse of the glasses; [viz, reciprocally in a simple proportion by reason of the spreading of the drop & its touching each glass in a larger surface; & again reciprocally in a simple proportion by reason of the attractions growing stronger within the same quantity of attracting surface. The attraction therefore within the same quantity of attracting surface, is reciprocally as the distance between the glasses. And therefore where the distance is exceeding small, the attraction must be exceeding great. By the Table in the second part of the second Book, wherein the thicknesses of coloured plates of water between two glasses are set down, the thickness of the Plate where it appears very black, is three eighths of the ten hundred thousandth part of an inch. And where the oyle of Oranges between the glasses is of this thickness, the attraction collected by the foregoing Rule, seems to be so strong, as within a circle of an inch in diameter to suffice to hold up a weight equal to that of a cylinder of water of an inch in diameter & two or three furlongs in length. And where it is of a less thickness the attraction may be proportionally greater, & continue to increase untill the thickness do not exceed that of a single particle of the Oyle. There are therefore Agents in nature able to make the particles of bodies stick together by very strong attractions. And it is the business of experimental Philosophy to find them out.
Now the smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest attractions & compose bigger particles of weaker vertue, & many of these may cohere & compose bigger particles whose vertue is still weaker, & so on for divers successions untill the progression end in the biggest particles on which the operations in Chymistry & the colours of natural bodies depend & which by cohering compose bodies of a sensible magnitude. If the body is compact & bends or yeilds inward to pression without any sliding of its parts, it is hard & elastick, returning to its figure with a force arising from the mutual attraction of its parts. If the parts slide upon one another the body is malleable or soft. If they slip easily & are of a fit size to be agitated by heat, & the heat is big enough to keep them in agitation the body is fluid; & if it be apt to stick to things it is humid; & the drops of every fluid affect a round figure by the mutual attraction of their parts, as the globe of the Earth & Sea affects a round figure by the mutuall attraction of its parts by gravity.
Since metalls dissolved in acids attract but a small quantity of the acid, their attractive force can reach but to a small distance from them. And as in Algebra, where affirmative quantities vanish & cease, there negative ones begin, so in Mechanicks, where attraction ceases there a repulsive vertue ought to succeed. And that there is such a vertue seems to follow from the reflexions & inflexions of the rays of light. For the rays are repelled by bodies in both these cases without the immediate contact of the reflecting or inflecting body. It seems also to follow from the emission of light, the ray so soon as it is shaken off from a shining body by the vibrating motion of the parts of the body, & gets beyond the reach of attraction, being driven away with exceeding great velocity. For that <281r> force which is sufficient to turn it back in reflexion may be sufficient to emit it. It seems also to follow from the production of Air & Vapor. The particles when they are shaken off from bodies by heat or fermentation, so soon as they are beyond the reach of the attraction of the body, receding from it, & also from one another with great strength, & keeping at a distance, so as sometimes to take up above a million of times more space then they did before in the form of a dense body. Which vast contraction & expansion seems unintelligible by feigning the particles of Air to be springy & ramous, or rolled up like hoops, or by any other means then a repulsive power. The particles of fluids which do not cohere too strongly & are of such a smallness as renders them most susceptible of those agitations which keep liquors in a fluor, are most easily separated & rarefied into vapor, & in the language of the Chymists, they are volatile, rarefying with an easy heat & condensing with cold. But those which are grosser & so less susceptible of agitation or cohere by a stronger attraction, are not separated without a stronger heat, or perhaps, not without fermentation. And these last are the bodies which Chemists call fixed, & being rarefied by fermentation become true permanent air: those particles receding from one another with the greatest force, & being most difficultly brought together, which upon contact cohere most strongly. And because the particles of permanent Air are grosser & arise from denser substances then those of vapors, thence it is that true Air is more ponderous then vapor, & that a moist atmosphere is lighter then a dry one quantity for quantity. From the same repelling power it seems to be that flyes walk upon the water without wetting their feet; & that the Object-glasses of long Telescopes lye upon one another without touching; & that dry pouders are difficultly made to touch one another so as to stick together, unless by melting them, or wetting them with water which by exhaling may bring them together; & that two polished marbles which by immediate contact stick together, are difficultly brought so close together as to stick.
And thus Nature will be very conformable to her self & very simple, performing all the great motions of the heavenly bodies by the attraction of gravity which intercedes those bodies, & almost all the small ones of their particles by some other attractive & repelling powers which interceede the particles. The Vis inertiæ is a passive principle by which bodies persist in their motion or rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing it, & resist as much as they are resisted. By this Principle alone there never could have been any motion in the world. Some other Principle was necessary for putting bodies into motion; & now they are in motion some other Principle is necessary for conserving the motion. For from the various composition of two motions tis very certain that there is not always the same quantity of motion in the world. For if two globes joyned by a slender rod, revolve about their common center of gravity with an uniform motion while that center moves on uniformly in a right line drawn in the plane of their circular motion; the summ of the motions of the two globes, as often as the globes are in the right line described by their common center of gravity, will be bigger then the summ of their motions when they are in a line perpendicular to that right line. By this instance it appears that motion may be got or lost. But by reason of the tenacity of fluids, & attrition of their parts, & the weakness of elasticity in solids, motion is much more apt to be lost then got, & is always upon the decay. For bodies which are either absolutely hard, or so soft as to be void of elasticity, will not rebound from one another. Impenetrability makes them only stop. If two equal bodies meet directly in Vacuo <282r> they will by the laws of motion stop where they meet & lose all their motion & remain in rest unless they be elastick & receive new motion from their spring. If they have so much elasticity as suffices to make them rebound with a quarter or half or three quarters of the force with which they come together, they will lose three quarters or half or a quarter of their motion. And this may be tried by letting two equal Pendulums fall against one another from equal heights. If the Pendulums be of lead or soft clay they will lose all or almost all their motions: if of elastick bodies they will lose all but what they recover from their elasticity. If it be said that they can lose no motion but what they communicate to other bodies; the consequence is that in Vacuo they can lose no motion, but when they meet they must go on & penetrate one anothers dimensions. If three equal round Vessels be filled the one with water, the other with oyle, the third with molten pitch, & the liquors be stirred about alike to give them a vortical motion: the pitch by its tenacity will lose its motion quickly, the oyle being less tenacious will keep it longer, & the water being least tenacious will keep it longest, but yet will lose it in a short time. Whence it is easy to understand that if many contiguous Vortices of molten pitch were each of {them} as large as those which some suppose to revolve about the Sun & fixt starrs, yet these & all their parts would by their tenacity & stifness communicate their motion to one another till they all rested among themselves. Vortices of oyle or water or some fluider matter might continue longer in motion, but unless the matter were void of all tenacity & attrition of parts & communication of motion (which is not to be supposed,) the motion would constantly decay. Seing therefore the variety of motion which we find in the world is always decreasing, there is a necessity of conserving & recruiting it by active principles, such as are the cause of gravity by which Planets & Comets keep their motions in their Orbs & bodies acquire great motion in falling; & the cause of fermentation by which the heart & blood of animals are kept in perpetual motion & heat, the inward parts of the earth are constantly warmed & in some places grow very hot, bodies burn & shine, mountains take fire, the caverns of the earth are blown up, & the Sun continues violently hot & lucid & warms all things by his light. For we meet with very little motion in the world besides what is oweing to these active Principles. And if it were not for these Principles the bodies of the Earth, Planets, Comets, Sun, & all things in them would grow cold & freeze & become inactive masses, & all putrefaction generation vegetation & life would cease, & the Planets & Comets would not remain in their Orbs.
All these things being considered, it seems to me that God in the beginning formed matter in solid massy hard impenetrable moveable particles of such sizes & figures & with such other properties & in such proportion to space as most conduced to the end for which he formed them, & that these primitive particles being solids are incomparably harder then any porous bodies compounded of them; even so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces: no ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the first creation. While the particles continue entire they may compose bodies of one & the same nature & texture in all ages: but should they weare away, or break in pieces, the nature of things depending on them, would be changed. Water & Earth composed of old worn particles & fragments of particles would not be of the same nature & texture now with water & earth composed of entire particles in the beginning. And therefore that nature may be lasting, the changes of corporeal things are to be placed only in the various separations & new associations & motions of these permanent particles; compound bodies being apt to break, not in the midst of solid particles, but where those particles are laid together & only touch in a few points.
<283r>
It seems to me further that these particles have not only a Vis inertiæ accompanied with such passive laws of motion as naturally result from that force, but also that they are moved by certain active principles such as is that of Gravity & that which causes fermentation & the cohesion of bodies. These Principles I consider not as Occult Qualities supposed to result from the specific forms of things, but as general laws of nature by which the things [themselves are formed: their truth appearing to us by phænomena though their causes be not yet discovered. For these are manifest qualities, & their causes only are occult. To tell us that every species of things is endowed with an occult specific quality by which it acts & produces manifest effects, is to tell us nothing: but to derive two or three general Principles of motion from Phænomena, & afterwards to tell us how the properties & actions of all corporeal things follow from those manifest Principles, would be a very great step in Philosophy, tho the causes of those Principles were not yet discovered: & therefore I scruple not to propose the Principles of motion above mentioned, they being of very general extent, & leave their causes to be found out.
Now by the help of these Principles all material things seem to have been composed of the hard & solid Particles above mentioned variously associated in the first creation by the counsell of an intelligent Agent. For it became him who created them to set them in order. And if he did so, it's unphilosophical to seek for any other origin of the world, or to pretend that it might arise out of a Chaos by the mere laws of nature; tho being once formed it may continue by those laws for many ages. For while Comets move in very excentric Orbs in all manner of positions, blind fate could never make all the Planets move one & the same way in Orbs concentrick, some inconsiderable irregularities excepted which may have risen from the mutual actions of Comets & Planets upon one another, & which will be apt to increase till this Systeme wants a reformation. Such a wonderfull uniformity in the Planetary Systeme must be allowed the effect of choise. And so must the uniformity in the bodies of Animals, they having generally a right & a left side shaped alike & on either side of their bodies two leggs behind & either two arms or two leggs or two wings before upon their sholders & between their sholders a neck running down into a back bone & a head upon it, & in the head two ears, two eyes, a nose, a mouth & a tongue alike situated. Also the first contrivance of those very artificial parts of animals, the eyes, ears, brain, muscles, heart, Lungs, Midriff, Glands, Larynx, Hands, Wings, Swimming-bladders, natural Spectables, & other organs of sense & motion, & the Instinct of Brutes & Insects, can be the effect of nothing else then the wisdome & skill of a powerful ever living agent, who being in all places is more able by his Will to move the bodies within his boundless unorganized uniform Sensorium & thereby to form & reform the parts of the Universe, then we are by our will to move the parts of our own bodies. And yet we are not to consider the world as the body of God or the several parts thereof as the parts of God. He is an uniform Being void of Organs, Members, or Parts, & they are his Creatures subordinate to him & subservient to his will, & he is no more the soul of them then the Soul of a man is the Soul of the Species of things carried through the Organs of Sense into the place of its sensation, where it perceives them by means of its immediate presence without the intervention of any third thing. The Organs of Sense are not for enabling the soul to perceive the Species of things in its Sensorium, but only for conveying them thither, & God has no need of such Organs, he being every where present to the things themselves. And since space is divisible in infinitum & matter is not necessarily in all places, it may be also allowed that God is able to create particles o{f} <284r> matter of several sizes & figures & in several proportions to space, & perhaps of different densities & forces, & thereby to vary the Laws of Nature, & make worlds of several sorts in several parts of the Universe. At least I see nothing of contradiction in all this.
As in Mathematicks so in Natural Philosophy the investigation of difficult things by the Method of Analysis ought ever to precede the method of composition. This Analysis consists in making Experiments & observations & in drawing general conclusions from them by Induction, & admitting of no objections against the Conclusions but such as are taken from experiments or other certain truths. For Hypotheses are not to be regarded in experimental Philosophy. And altho the arguing from experiments & observations by Induction be no demonstration of general Conclusions yet it is the best way of arguing which the nature of things admits of, & may be looked upon as so much the stronger by how much the Induction is more general And if no exception occur from Phænomena the conclusion may be pronounced generally. But if at any time afterwards any exception shall occur from experiments, it may then begin to be pronounced with such exceptions as occur. By this way of Analysis we may proceed from compounds to ingredients, & from motions to the forces producing them, & in general from effects to their causes, & from particular causes to more general ones, till the Argument end in the most general. This is the Method of Analysis: & the Synthesis consists in assuming the causes discovered & established as Principles, & by them explaining the Phenomena proceeding from them, & proving the explanations.
In the two first books of these Opticks, I proceeded by this Analysis to discover & prove the original differences of the rays of light in respect of refrangibility, reflexibility, & colour, & their alternate fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission, & the properties of bodies both opake & pellucid on which their reflexions & colours depend. And these discoveries being proved may be assumed in the method of Composition for explaining the Phænomena arising from them: an instance of which Method I gave in the end of the first Book. In this third Book I have only begun the Analysis of what remains to be discovered about light & its effects upon the frame of nature, hinting several things about it & leaving the hints to be examined & improved by the farther experiments & observations of such as are inquisitive. And if natural Philosophy in all its parts, by pursuing this method, shall at length be perfected, the bounds of moral Philosophy will be also enlarged. For so far as we can know by Natural Philosophy what is the first Cause, what power he has over us, & what benefits we receive from him, so far our duty towards him as well as that towards one another, will appear to us by the light of Nature. And no doubt, if the worship of fals Gods had not blinded the heathen, their moral Philosophy would have gone further then to the four Cardinal Vertues; & instead of teaching the transmigration of souls & to worship the Sun & Moon & dead Heroes, they would have taught us to worship our true Author & Benefactor.

Qu. 20. Are not the rays of light very small bodies refracted by means of certain attractions which intercede then & the parts of pellucid bodies? The common opinions are that light is made either by pression or motion propagated through a fluid or by bodies projected. If it consisted only in pression propagated without actual motion, it would not be able to agitate & heate the bodies which refract & reflect it. If it consisted in motion propagated to all distances in an instant, it would require an infinite force to generate that motion. Light moves in right lines without bending or spreading into the shadow beyond the bounds of those right lines in which it begins to move. But pression or motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines beyond an obstacle which stops part of the motion; but bends & spreads every way into the quiescent medium which lies beyond the obstacle. Gravity tends downwards, but the pressure of water arising from gravity tends every way with equal force & is propagated as readily & with as much force side ways as downwards & through crooked passages as through streight ones. The waves on the surface of water passing by the sides of a broad obstacle bend & dilate themselves gradually into the quiet water behind the obstacle. The waves pulses or vibrations of the Air wherein sounds consist bend manifestly tho not so much as the waves of water. For a Bell or a Canon may be heard beyond a hill which intercepts the sight of the sounding body & sounds are propagated as readily through crooked pipes as through streight ones. But light is never known to follow crooked passages nor to bend into the shadow For the fixt stars by the interposition of any of the Planets cease to be seen & so do the parts of the Sun by the interposition of the Moon Mercury or Venus. The rays which pass very neare to the edges of any body are bent a little by the action of the body as we shewed above; but this bending is not towards but from the shadow & is performed only in the passage of the ray by the body. So soon as the ray is past the body it goes right on.
To explain the unusual refraction of Island-Crystal by pression or motion propagated has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge) except by Hugenius who for that end supposed two several vibrating Mediums within that crystal: but when he tried the refractions in two successive pieces of that crystal & found them such as is mentioned in the two last preceding Questions; he confest himself at a loss for explaining them: For pressions or motions propagated from a shining body through an uniform medium must be on all sides alike: whereas by those experiments it appears that the rays of light have different properties in their different sides. He suspected that the pulses of Æther in passing through the first crystal might receive certain new modifications which might determin them to be propagated in this or that Medium within the second crystal according to the position of that crystal: but what modifications those might be he could not say nor think of any thing satisfactory in this point.: And its more difficult to conceive how such modifications can be in the rays originally, if light be nothing else then pression or motion propagated through fluids. For the refractions reflexions <288r> inflexions & colours of light depend on such properties as are in the rays originaly & suffer no change by the passing of the rays through several mediums: & therefore all Hypotheses are to be laid aside in which those phænomena are derived from new modifications of the rays.
By the regular & very lasting motions of Comets & Planets through the heavens in all manner of positions its manifest that the heavens are void of all sensible resistence [& therefore may let the rays of light go through them in right lines with an uniform motion to very great distances, although those rays should be bodies]. The resistance of fluid Mediums arises partly from the attrition of the parts of the Medium & principally from the Vis inertiæ of the matter. That part of the resistance which arises from the attrition of the parts may be diminished by dividing the matter into smaller parts & making the parts more smooth & slippery: but that part of the resistance which arises from the Vis inertiæ is proportional to the density of the matter & cannot be diminished by dividing the matter nor by any other means then by decreasing the density. And for these reasons the density of fluid Mediums is very nearly proportional to their resistance Water is 13 or 14 times lighter then Quicksilver, & by consequence 13 or 14 times rarer, & it's resistance is less then that of Quicksilver in the same proportion or thereabouts as I have found by Pendulums. The open Air in which we breath is eight or nine hundred times lighter then water, & by consequence eight or nine hundred times rarer, & accordingly its resistance is less then that of water in the same proportion or thereabouts as I have also found by Pendulums.. And if the Air be made still thinner & thinner its resistance becomes less & less untill it be insensible. < insertion from the middle of f 287v > And in thinner Air the resistance is still less & by rarefying the air becomes at length insensible. < text from f 288r resumes > For feathers falling in the open Air meet with great resistance but in a tall glass wall emptied of Air they fall as fast as lead or gold as I have seen tried several times. And the heavens are emptier of Air then any Vacuum we can make below & therefore have less resistance. Liquors which differ not much in density, as water spirit of wine spirit of Turpentine, hot oyle, differ not much in resistance, & the reason is because their rersistances arise chiefly from the Vis inertiæ. Heat increases fluidity & makes many bodies fluid which are not fluid in cold & accordingly decreases their resistance as may be tried in oyle but decreases not the resistance of water considerably as it would do if any great part of its resistance arose from the attrition or tenacity of its parts, & therefore the resistence of water arises chiefly from the Vis inertiæ; & by consequence if the heavens were as dense as water they would not have much less resistence then water, if as dense as quicksilver they would not have much less resistence then quicksilver, if absolutely dense or full of matter without any Vacuum, let the matter be never so fluid, they would have a greater resistance then Quicksilver. A solid globe in such a Medium would lose above half its motion in moving three times the length of its diameter & a globe not solid would be retarded sooner. And therefore to make way for the lasting motions of Comets & Planets its necessary to empty the heavens of all matter except perhaps some very thin vapors steams or effluvia arising from the Atmospheres of the Earth Planets & Comets. Such matter is of no use for explaining the Phenomena of nature, the motions of the Planets & Comets being better explained by gravity without it, & gravity not being hitherto explained by it. It serves only to disturbe & retard the motions of those great bodies & make the frame of nature languish & in the pores of bodies it serves only to stop the vibrating motions of their parts wherein their heat & activity consists.. And as it is of no use & hinders the operations of nature & makes her languish so there is no evidence for its existence; & therefore it ought to be rejected. And if it be rejected, the Hypotheses that light consists in pression or motion propagated <289r> through such a Medium are rejected with it. And for rejecting such a Medium we have also the authority of those the oldest & most celebrated Philosophers of Greece & Phenicia, who made a Vacuum, Atoms & the gravity of Atoms the first principles of their philosophy
I have therefore proposed the Question whether the rays of light may not be small bodies emitted by shining substances. Certainly the resemblance between the rays & such bodies is very great. For such bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in right lines without bending into the shadow which is the property of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon the rays of light at a distance in refracting reflecting & inflecting them, & the rays mutually agitate the parts of those substances at a distance for heating them, & this action & reaction very much resembles an attractive force. If refraction be performed by attraction of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction in a given proportion as we shewed in our Principles of Philosophy; & this Rule is true by experience. If the rays of light in going out of a glass into a Vacuum fall too obliquely on the Vacuum, they are totaly reflected which seems to argue an attraction of the glass. Colours & Refractions depend not on new modifications of light but on the original & unchangeable properties of its rays, & such properties are best conserved in bodies projected. Pressions & motions are apt to receive new modifications in passing through several Mediums but the properties of bodies projected will scarce be altered thereby. Nothing more is requisite for producing all the variety of colours & degrees of refrangibility then that the rays be bodies of different sizes the least of which may make violet the weakest & darkest of colours & be more easily diverted by refracting surfaces from the right course, & the rest, as they are bigger & bigger may make the stronger & more lucid colours, blue green yellow & red & be more & more difficultly diverted. And lastly the unusual refraction of Island Crystal looks very much as if it were performed by some kind of attractive vertue lodged in certain sides both of the rays & of the particles of the crystall. For were it not for some kind of disposition or vertue in some sides of the particles of the crystal which is not in their other sides & which inclines & bends the rays towards the coasts of unusual refraction the rays which fall perpendicularly on the crystal would not be refracted towards that coast rather then towards any other coast, Both at their incidence & at their emergence, so as to emerge perpendicularly by a contrary situation of the coast of unusual refraction at the second surface; the crystal acting upon the rays after they have past through it & are emerging into the air or if you please into a vacuum. And since the crystal by this disposition or vertue does not act upon the rays unless when one of their sides of unusual refraction are look | are turned towards that coast this argues a vertue or disposition in those sides of the rays which answers to & sympathizes with that vertue or disposition of the crystal, as the poles of two Magnets answer one to another. And as magnetism may be intended & remitted & is found only in the Magnet & in iron, so this vertue of refracting the perpendicular rays is greater in Island Crystal less in Crystal of the rock & is not yet found in other bodies. But what ever this vertue be <290r> tis very difficult to conceive how the rays of light, unless they be bodies, can have a permanent vertue in two of their sides opposite one to another which is not in their other sides, & this without any dependence on the Medium through which they are propagated; the like sides of several rays not looking all towards the same coast but being turned several ways before their incidence on the first crystal, & looking indifferently towards any coast as the rays happen to be emitted from shining substances in several positions, & accordingly as they are turned to this or that coast, being refracted at their incidence on the first crystal & again at their emergence out of it some after the usual & some after the unusual manner.

When Oyle of Vitriol is run per deliquium & in destillation the water ascends difficultly & brings over with it some part of the oyle of Vitriol in the form of spirit of Vitriol & this spirit being poured upon iron copper or salt of tartar unites with the body & lets go the water: does not this shew that the acid spirit is attracted by the water & more attracted by the fixt body then by the water & therefore lets go the water to close with the fixt body. And is it not for the same reason that the water & acid spirits in Vinegar, Aqua fortis or Spirit of salt cohere & rise together in destillation; but if the menstruum be poured on salt of tartar of on Lead or iron or any fixt body which it can dissolve the acid by a stronger attraction adheres to the body & lets go the water.

When aqua fortis dissolves silver & not gold & aqua regis dissolves gold & not silver may it not be said that Aqua fortis is subtile enough to penetrate as well as silver but wants the attractive force to give it entrance & that Aqua Regis is subtile enough to penetrate silver but wants the attractive force to give it entrance. For aqua Regis is compounded of Aqua fortis [which is subtile enough to enter silver:] &: common salt added to Aqua fortis enables the menstruum to dissolve gold tho the common salt be a gross body. When therefore spirit of salt precipitates silver out of Aqua fortis is it not by attracting mixing with the aqua fortis & repelling the silver. And when water precipitates Antimony out of sublimate of Antimony & Salarmoniac or out of butter of Antimony, is it not done by attracting dissolving & weakening the salarmoniac or the spirit of salt & repelling the Antimony. Is it not also for want of an attractive vertue between the parts of water & oyle, of Quicksilver & Antimony, Lead & Iron that these substances do not mix & by a strong attractive vertue that some bodies mix readily as Quicksilver & Tin, Antimony & Iron, Water & salts & by a weaker one that others mix difficultly as {Q}uicksilver & copper? And is it not in general from the same principle that heat congregates homogeneal bodies & seperates heterogeneal ones.

Qu. 21. Do not bodies & light mutualy change into one another. And may not bodies receive their most active powers from the particles of light of which enter their composition? For all fixt bodies emit light so long as they continue sufficiently hot & light mutualy stops in bodies as often as its rays strike upon their parts, as we shewed above. I know no body less apt to shine then water & yet water by frequent destillations changes into fixed earth & this earth shines as much by heat as any other body. The changing of bodies into light & light into bodies is very conformable to the course of nature which seems to delight in transmutations. Water which is a very fluid volatile tastles salt she changes by heat into vapour which is a sort of air & by cold into into ice which is a hard pellucid brittle fusible stone, & this stone returns into water by heat & vapour returns into water by cold. Earth by heat becomes fire & by cold returns into earth. Dense bodies by fermentation rarefy into several sorts of aer & this aer & this aer by fermentation & sometimes without it return into dense bodies. [Quicksilver dropt into a red hot earthen {r}etort ascends in the form of vapour which recondenses into a pellucid liquor like common water in appearance & this liquor being left a few days in the cold air returns in Quicksilver]. All Birds Beasts & Fishes, Trees & other Vegetables with their several parts grow out of water & watry tinctures & by putrefaction return again into watry substances. And water standing a few days in the open Air yeilds a tincture which (like that of Mault) by standing longer yeilds a sediment & a spirit, but before putrefaction is fit nourishment for animals & vegetables And if bodies turn into light & light return into bodies, 'tis a transmutation agreable to the proceeding of Nature in the rest of her works.
Mercury appears sometimes in the form of a fluid ponderous opake bright tastles Metal, sometimes in the form of a hard brittle metal sometimes in the form of a corrosive pellucid salt called sublimate or in that of a tastles pellucid volatile earth called Mercurius dulcis, or of a red opake volatile earth called cinnaber or of a red or white precipitate, or in the form of a fluid salt or in that of air ✝ < insertion from f 292r > ✝ & being dropt into a red hot earthen Retort it destills in the form of common water. < text from f 291v resumes > & after all these & other changes it returns again into Mercury ‡ < insertion from f 292r > ‡ & being agitated in vacuo it shines < text from f 291v resumes > .
Now since light is the most active of all bodies known to us, & enters the composition of all natural bodies, why may it not be the chief principle of activity in them? Attraction ought to be strongest in the smallest particles in proportion to their bulk. Tis much stronger in small magnets in proportion {to} their bulk then in great ones. And considering how much the rays of ligh{t are} bent at {the}ir entrance into pellucid bodies, we may reccon that the attractive power of {the r}ay of light in proportion to its body is as much greater then the gravity of a projectile in proportion to its body as the velocity of the ray of light is greater then the velocity of the projectile & the bent of the ray greater then the bent of the line described by the projectile, supposing the inclination of the ray to refracting surface & that of the projectile to the Horizon to be alike. And by this proportion I reccon the attractive force of rays of light above ten hundred thousand thousand millions of times greater then the force whereby bodies gravitate on the surface of this earth in proportion to the matter in them. supposing that light comes from the Sun to us in about 7 minutes of an hour. And so great a force in the rays cannot but have a very great effect upon the particles of matter with which they are compounded, for causing them to attract one another. Let us therefore see if they have not such attractions 
<292r>
Now attraction in bodies of the same kind & vertue is strongest in the smallest bodies in proportion to their bulk. It is found stronger in small magnets for their weight then in great ones. For the parts of small ones being close together unite their forces more easily. And therefore the rays of light being the smallest bodies known to us, we may expect to find their attraction very strong in them. And how strong it is may be gathered by this Rule. The attraction of a ray of light in proportion to its body is to the gravity of a projectile in proportion to its body, as in a compound ratio of the velocity of the ray of light to the velocity of the projectile & of the bent of the ray to the bent of the projetile, supposing the
We have shewed that the attraction of
The smallest particles of matter may cohere by the strongest attractions & compose bigger particles of weaker vertue & many of these may cohere & compose a bigger particle whose vertue is still weaker & so on for divers successions untill the progression end in the biggest particles on which the operations in Chymistry & the colours of natural bodies depend, & which by cohering compose bodies of a sensible magnitude.
Since metals dissolve in acids attract but a smal quantity of the acid, their attractive force can reach but to a small distance from them. And as in Algebra where affirmative quantities vanish & cease, there negative ones begin so in Mechanicks where attraction ceases there a repulsive vertue ought to begin. [By this vertue the rays of light are emitted from shining substances & reflected by the bodies they fall upon & in their passage by the sides of bodies they are bent from the body. And by the same power the particles of air recede from one another, flys walk upon water without wetting their feet, & all dry things are difficultly made to touch one another, & Object glasses of long Telescopes laid upon another will scarce touch so as to make the black spot appear (as is described in the         Observation the 1t part of the second book) unless they be pressed together, & when the pressure ceases the glasses recede from one another.] And that there is such a vertue seems to follow from the reflection & inflexion of light. For in both these cases the rays of light are repelled without the immediate contact of the reflecting or inflecting body. It seems also to follow from the emission of light the ray so soon as it is shaken off from a shining body by the vibrating motion of the parts of the body & gets beyond the reach of attraction being driven away with exceeding great velocity. For that force which is great enough to turn it back in reflection may be great enought to give it its motion in emission. It seems to follow also from the production of air vapour the particles of bodies when shaken off from the bodies by heat or fermentation, so soon as they are beyond the reach of attraction recede from the bodies & also from one another with great strength & keepe at a distance. The particles of fluids which do not adhere too strongly to one another & are of such a smallness as renders them most susceptible of those agitations which keep liquor in a fluor, being most easily rarefied, or to use the language of the Chemists, being most volatile. These rarefy into vapor by an easy heat & condense by cold: but those which are larger & less susceptible of agitation or cohere by a stronger attraction are not seperated without a stronger heat or perhaps not without fermentation. And these last are the bodies which Chemists called fixed & which being rarefied become true permanent air; those particles receding from one another with the greatest force which upon contact cohere most strongly. And because the particles of permanent air are grosser & denser then those of vapors, thence it is that true air is more ponderous then vapour & that a moist Atmosphere is lighter then a dry one, quantity for quantity, as {illeg}ned by the Barometer.

And for rejecting such a Medium we have the authority of those oldest & most celebrated Philosophers who made Atoms, Vacuum & the Gravity of Atoms the first principles of their Philosophy, understanding by atoms the least particles of matter & accounting them indivisible not by reason of their littleness but because of their being solids void of all {pores}, & attributing to every atom a gravity proportional to the quantity of its matter, without assigning the cause of such a gravity.
1 Move in right lines. 4 reflected entire at going out of glass. 5 Original properties immutable no new modifications. 3 proportion of sines. 2 act at a distance. 6 double refraction.
I have therefor proposed the Question whether the rays of light may not be small bodies emitted by shinning substances. Certainly the resemblance between them is very great. For such bodies will pass through uniform Mediums in right lines without bending into the shadow which is the property of the rays of light. Pellucid substances act upon the rays of light at a distance in {re}fracting reflecting & inflecting them, & the rays mutually agitate the parts of those substances at a distance for heating them & this action & reaction very much resembles an attractive force If refraction be performed by attraction of the rays, the sines of incidence must be to the sines of refraction in a given proportion as we shewed in our Principles: And this Rule is true by experience. If The rays of light in going out of glass into a vacuum fall too obliquely on the vacuum they are totally reflected, which seems to an attraction of the glass Colours & refractions depend not on new modifications of light but on the original & unchangeable properties of its rays & such properties are best conserved in bodies projected. Pressions & motions are apt to receive new modifications in passing through several mediums but the properties of bodies projected will scarce be altered thereby. Nothing more is requisite for the diversity of colours & degrees of refrangibility then that the rays be bodies of different sizes, the least of which may make violet the darkest of colours , & be most easily diverted by refraction from the right course & the rest as they are bigger & bigger may make the more lucid colours blue green yellow & red, & be more & more difficultly diverted by the refracting surface. And lastly the unusual refraction of Island Crystal looks very much as if it was performed by some kind of polar vertue both in the rays & in the particles of the crystal. For were it not for some kind of polar vertue in the particles of the crystal which draws the rays towards the coast of unusual refraction the rays would not be refracted towards that coast when they fall perpendicularly on the glass. And since the crystal by this vertue does not act upon the rays unless when their sides of unusual refraction are towards that coast this argues a virtue in those two sides of the rays which answers to that vertue of the crystal as the poles of two Magnets answer one to another And as Magnetism is not found in all bodies & may be intended & remitted so this vertue of refracting the perpendicular rays is not found in all refracting substances & is greater in Island Crystal less in Crystal of the rock. But what ever this vertue be tis very difficult to conceive how the rays of light unless they be bodies can have a permanent vertue in two of their sides opposite one to another which is not in their other sides; & this without any dependance on the Medium through which they are propagated; the like sides of several rays looking towards several coasts before their incidence on the first crystal, & being turned indifferently towards any coast as the rays happen to be emitted from shining substance in several positions, & accordingly as they are turned to this or that being refracted at their incidence on the first crystal some after the unusual & some after the usual manner

And do not hot bodies communicate their heat to contiguous cold ones by the vibrations of this Medium propagated from them into the cold ones. 1 And do not the vibrations of this Medium in hot bodies contribute to the duration of their heat?   
Pag. 133. lin. ult. After the word [parts?] add. And do not all bodies which abound with terrestrial parts & especially with suphureous ones, emit light as often as those parts are sufficiently agitated; whether that agitation be made by heat, or by friction or percussion or putrefaction or by any vital motion or any other cause? as for instance, Sea-water in a raging storm, quicksilver agitated in vacuo; the back of a Cat or neck of a horse obliquely struck or rubbed in a dark place; wood flesh & fish while they putrefy; Vapors arising from putrid waters usually called Ignes fatui; stacks of moist hay or corn growing hot by fermentation; glow worms & the eyes of some animals by vital motions; the vulgar Phosphorus agitated by the attrition of any body or by the acid particles of the Air; Ambar & some Diamonds by striking pressing or rubbing them; scrapings of steel struck off with a flint; iron hammered very nimbly till it becomes so hot as to kindle sulphur thrown upon it; the axe trees of chariots taking fire by the rapid rotation of the wheels; and some liquors mixed with one another whose particles come together with an impetus; as Oyl of Vitriol destilled from its weight of Nitre & then mixed with twice its weight of Oyle of Annisseeds. So also a globe of glass about 8 or 10 inches in diameter, being put into a frame where it may be turned swiftly round its axis, will in turning shine where it rubs against the palm of ones hand applied to it, & if at the same time a piece of white paper or white cloth or the end of ones finger be held at the distance of about a quarter of an inch or half an inch from that part of the glass where it is most in motion, the electric vapour which is excited by the friction of the glass against the hand, will by dashing against the white paper cloth or finger be put into such an agitation as to emit light & make the white paper, cloth or finger appear lucid like a glow worm.
Pag. 134 lin. ult. After the word [flame] add: When Gun-powder takes fire it goes away into flaming smoak. For the charcoal & sulphur easily take fire, & set fire to the Nitre, & the spirit of the Nitre being thereby rarefied into vapour, rushes out with explosion much after the manner that the vapour of water rushes out of an olipile; & the sulphur also being volatile is converted into vapor & thereby augments the explosion. Also the acid vapor of the sulphur (namely that which destills under a Bell into Oyle of Sulphur) entring violently into the fixt body of the Nitre, sets loose the spirit of the Nitre, & excites a great fermentation whereby the heat is further augmented & the fixt body of the Nitre is also rarefied into fume, & the explosion thereby made more vehement & quick. For if Salt of Tartar be mixed with Gun pouder & that mixture be warmed till it takes fire; the explosion will be more violent & quick then that of Gunpowder alone: which cannot be from any other cause then the action of the vapor of the Gunpouder upon the salt of Tartar whereby that salt is rarefied. The explosion of Gunpowder arises therefore from the quick & violent action whereby all the mixture being quickly & vehemently heated, is rarefied & converted into fume or vapour: which vapour by the violence of that action is at the same time heated & becoming red hot appears in the form of flame.
Pag. 135 lin. 16. After the words, [arise from them?] add For if water is made warm in any pellucid vessel, & the Aer is afterwards drawn out of the vessel, that water in the vacuum will bubble & boyle as vehemently as it would in the open aer in a vessel set upon the fire till it conceives a much greater heat. For the weight of the incumbent Atmosphere keeps down the vapours & hinders the water from boyling untill it grow much hotter then is requisite to make it boyle in Vacuo. Also a mixture of Tinn & Lead being put upon a red hot iron in vacuo, emits a fume & also a <295r> flame: but the same mixture in the open air, by reason of the weight of the incumbent Atmosphere does not so much as emit any fume which can be perceived by sight. In like manner the great weight of the Atmosphere which lyes upon the globe of the Sun, may hinder bodies there from rising & going away from the Sun in the form of vapours & fumes unless by means of a far greater heat then that which in the superficies of our Earth would very easily turn them into vapours & fumes: and the same great weight may condense those vapors & exhalations as soon as they shall ascend from the Sun, & make them presently fall back again into the globe of the Sun, & by that action increase the heat of the Sun much after the manner that in our earth the Aer increases the heat of a culinary fire. And the same weight may hinder the globe of the Sun from being diminished unless perhaps by the emission of light, & a very small quantity of vapors & exhalations.
Pag. 134 lin 1 insert Qu. 18B. Do not electric bodies by friction emit a subtile exhalation or spirit by which they perform their attractions? And is not this spirit of a very active nature & capable of emitting light by its agitations? And may not all bodies abound with such a spirit & shine by the agitations of this spirit within them when sufficiently heated? For if a long cylindrical piece of Ambar be rubbed nimbly it will shine in the dark & if when it is well rubbed the finger of a man be held neare it so as almost to touch it, the electric spirit will rush out of the Ambar with a soft crackling noise like that of green leaves of trees thrown into a fire, & in rushing out it will also push against the finger so as to be felt like the ends of hairs of a fine brush touching the finger. And the like happens in glass. If a long hollow tub{e} of flint glass about an inch be rubbed nimbly with a paper held in the hand till the glass grows warm, it will in rubbing emit light & the face or any other tender part of the skin being held neare that part of the glass where it has been most rubbed, the electric spirit which is excited by the friction will rush out of the glass with a cracking noise & push against the skin so as to be felt, & in pushing emit light so as to make the skin shine like rotten wood or a glow worm. And if the glass was held neare pieces of leaf brass scattered upon a table the electric spirit which issued out of the glass would stir them at the distance of 6, 8 or 10 inches or a foot, & put them into various brisk motions, making them sometimes leap towards the glass & stick to it, sometimes leap from it with great force, sometimes move towards it & from it several times with reciprocal motion, somtimes move in lines parall to the tube, sometimes remain suspended in the air, & sometimes move in various curve lines. Which motions shew that this spirit is agitated in various manners like a wind. And if a broad plate of glass be placed between the Tube & the pieces of brass, yet the Tube will attract them , tho not so strongly as when the plate of glass is taken away. Which shews that the electrick spirit is so subtile as readily to pass through glass tho not so readily as through the Air. And whilst it pervades dense bodies so easily, why may it not be latent in them all in some measure or other, tho those only emitt it by friction in which it abounds most copiously? And since it easily emits light by agitation, why may it not emit light in all dense bodies heated red hot & thereby cause them to shine?

And if the eye & the finger remain quiet these colours vanish in a second or two of time. But if the finger is moved forwards & backwards alternately these colours appear again while the finger is in motion. Do not — — — stroke? And when a coale of fire moved nimbly in the circumference of a circle makes the whole circumference appear like a circle of fire; is it not because the motions excited in the bottom of the eye by the rays of light are of a lasting nature & continue till the coale in going round returns to its former place? And are not these lasting motions excited in the bottom of the eye of a vibrating nature?
Qu. 17. If a stone be thrown into stagnating water the undulations excited thereby continue for some time in the place where the stone fell into the water, & are propagated thence in concentric circles to great distances. And when When light falls upon the surface of any pellucid body & is there refracted or reflected: do not the vibrations thereby excited in the refracting or reflecting Medium at the surface of the pellucid body continue as long as when they are excited in the bottom of the eye by the pressure & motion of the finger or by the light which comes from the coale of fire in the experiments above mentioned? And are not these Vibrations propagated from thence to great distances? And do they not overtake the rays of light, & by overtaking them successively do they not put the rays into the fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission described above?
Qu. 18. If 2 two little Thermometers be suspended 1 in two larg & tall cylindrical vessels of glass inverted, 3so as not to touch the vessels, & the air be drawn out of one of these vessels: When these vessels are carried into a warm place the Thermometer in vacuo will grow warm almost as soon as the other Thermometer which is not in vacuo. And when the vessels are carried into a cold place, the Thermometer in vacuo will grow cold almost as soon as the other Thermometer. Is not the heat of the warm room conveyed through the Vacuum by the vibrations of a much subtiler Medium. then air which after the Air is drawn out remains in the Vacuum. And is not this Medium the Medium by which light is refracted & reflected? And doth not light communicate heat to bodies by exciting vibrations in this Medium.
Qu. 19. Doth not the refraction of light proceed from the different density of this Medium in different places the light receding from the denser parts of the medium towards the rarer parts thereof? And is not the density thereof greater in free & open spaces void of air & other grosser bodies then within the pores of water, glass, crystal & other compact bodies? [And do not the rays of light recede from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer & thereby become refracted?]
Qu. 20. Doth not this Medium in passing out of water glass crystal & other compact & dense bodies into empty spaces, grow denser & denser by degrees, & by that means refract the rays of light not in a point but by bending them gradually in curve lines? And doth not the graduall condensation of this Medium extend to some distance from the bodies & thereby cause the inflexions of the rays of light which pass by the edges of compact bodies at some distance from the bodies.
Qu. 21. Is not this Medium [rarest within the densest bodies? And is it not much rarer within the Sun & Starrs & Planets then without them & in passing from them to great distances , doth it not grow denser & denser perpetually & thereby cause the gravity of those great bodies towards one another & of their parts towards the bodies, every body endeavouring to go from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer. For if a Medium be rarer within the suns body then at the distance of the tenth part of an inch from his body & if it be rarer at that distance from him then at the distance of Saturn from surface of the suns body then within him < insertion from f 293v > then at his surface & rarer there then at the distance of the tenth part of an inch from his body, & rarer then at the orb of Saturn: I see no reason why the increase of density should stop any where, & not rather be continued through all the distances from the Sun to Saturn & beyond. And tho this increase of density at great distances may be exceeding slow yet if the elastic force of this Medium be sufficiently great it may suffice
And in Mediums of the same density the elastic force being in a duplicate ratio of the swiftness of the vibrations the elastic force of this Medium must be 490000000000 times greater in proportion to its density then the elastic force of the Air is in proportion to its density. < text from f 295v resumes > 
I can see no reason why the increase of density should stop any where & not be continued through all the distances from the Sun to Saturn & beyond. And if the elastick force of this Medium may be very great, it may suffice to impel bodies from the denser parts of the Medium towards the rarer with all that force which wee call gravity. And that the elastick force of this Medium is very great may be gathered from the swiftness of its vibrations. Sounds move about 1140 English feet in a second of time & in eight minutes they move about 103 English miles. Light moves from the Sun to us in eight minutes which distance is about 72000000 English miles supposing the horizont{a}ll Parallax of the Sun to be about 12″. And the vibrations of this Medium, that they may cause <293v> the alternate fits of easy transmission & easy reflexion must be swifter then & by consequence above 700000 times swifter then sounds. And therefore the elastick force of this Medium in proportion to its density must be above 700000 x 700000 times greater then the elastick force of the Air is in proportion to its density.

Qu. 22. Is not vision performed by the vibrations of this spirit excited in the bottom of the eye by the rays of light? & propagated through the uniform solid & pellucid capellamenta of the auditory nerves in the place of sensation. And is not the performed by the vibrations either of this or some other Medium, excited in the auditory nerves by the tremors of the air & propagated through their pellucid capillamenta into the place of sensation. And so of the other senses.
Qu. 23. Is not animal motion performed by the vibrations of this Medium excited in the brain by the power of the will & propagated from thence through the solid & pellucid capillamenta of the nerves into the muscles for contracting or dilating them? I suppose the capillamenta to be solid uniform & pellucid that the motion may be propagated along them uniformly without interruption.
Qu. 24. Do not electric bodies by friction emit a subtile exhalation or spirit by which they perform their attractions? And is not this Spirit - - - - - - - - - - - & thereby cause them to shine.

Qu. 23. Is not electrical attraction & repulse performed by an exhalation which is raised out of the electrick body by friction & expanded to great distances & variously agitated like a turbulent wind. & which carrys light bodies along with it. & agitates them in various manners according to it own motions, making them go sometimes towards the electric body, sometimes from it & sometimes move with various other motions? And when this spirit looses its turbulent motions & begins to be recondensed & by condensation to return into the electric body doth it not carry light bodies along with it towards the electrick body & cause them to stick to it without further motion till they drop off? And is not this exhalation much more subtile then common Air or Vapour? For electric bodies attract straws & such light substances through a plate of glass interposed, tho not so vigorously. And may there not be other Exhalations & subtile invisible Mediums which may have considerable effects in the Phænomena of nature?
And the same things have been found by rubbing a long & large cylinder of glass or Ambar with a paper held in ones hand & continuing the friction till the glass grew warm.
Qu. 31. May not the mutual attraction of the small parts of bodies be sufficiently strong to make them cohere & compose very hard bodies
<296r>
Qu. 17. Are there not other original properties of the rays of light besides those already described? An instance of another original property we have in the refractions of Island-crystal described first by Erasmus Bartholin & afterwards more exactly by Hugenius in his book De la lumiere.. This crystal is a pellucid fusile stone clear as water or crystal of the rock & without colour, enduring a red heat without losing its transparency & in a very strong heat calcining without fusion. Steept a day or two in water it loses its natural polish. Being rubbed on cloth it attracts pieces of straws & other light things like Ambar or glass: & with Aqua fortis its makes an ebullition. It seems to be a sort of Talc & is found in form of an oblique Parallelopiped with six parallelogram sides & eight solid angles. The obtuse angles of the Parallelograms are each of them 101 degrees & 52 minutes, the acute ones 78deg. 8min. Two of the solid angles opposite to one another as C & E are compossed each of them with three of these obtuse angles & each of the other six with one obtuse <297r> & two acute ones. It cleaves easily in planes parallel to any of its sides & no{t} in any other planes. It cleaves with a glossy polite surface not perfectly plane but with some little uneavenness. It is easily scratcht & by reason of its softness it takes a polish very difficultly. It polishes better upon polished looking-glass then upon metal & perhaps better upon pitch leather or parchment. Afterwards it must be rubbed with a little oyle or white of an egg to fill up its scratches: whereby it will become very transparent & polite. But for several experiments it is not necessary to polish it. If a piece of this crystalline stone be laid upon a book every letter of the book seen through it will appear double by means of a double refraction. And if any beam of light falls either perpendicularly or in any angle upon any surface of this crystal it becomes divided into two beams by means of the same double refraction. Which beams are of the same colour with the incident beam of light & seem equal to one another in the quantity of their light or very nearly equal. One of these refractions is One of these refractions is performed by the usual Rule of Opticks, the sine of incidence out of Air into this Crystal being to the sine of refraction as five to three. The other refraction, which may be called the unusuall refraction, is performed by the following Rule.
Let ADBC represent the refracting surface of the Crystal, C the biggest solid angle at that surface, GEHF the opposite surface & CK a perpendicular on that surface. This perpendicular makes with the edge of the crystal CF an angle of 19deg. 3′. Joyne KF & in it take KL so that the angle KCL be 6deg 40′ & the angle LCF 12deg. 23′. And if ST represent any beam of light incident at T in any angle upon the refracting surface ADBC, let TV be the refracted beam determined by the given proportion of the sines 5 to 3 according to the usual rule of Opticks. Draw VX parallel & equal to KL. Draw it the same way from V in which L lieth from K, & joyning TX this line TX shall be the other refracted beam carried from T to X by the unusual refraction.
If therefore the incident beam ST be perpendicular to the refracting surface the two beams TV & TX into which it shall become divided shall be parallel to the lines CK & CL; one of those beams going through the crystall perpendicularly as it ought to do by the usual laws of Opticks, & the other TX by an unusual refraction diverging from the perpendicular & making with it an angle VTX of about 6 degrees, as is found by experience. And hence the plane VTX & such like planes which are parallel to the plane CFK may be called the planes of perpendicular refraction. And the coast towards which the lines KL & VX are drawn may be called the coast of unusual refraction.
In like manner Crystal of the rock has a double refraction: but the difference of the two refractions is not so great & manifest as in Island Crystal.
When the beam ST incident on Island Crystal <298r> is divided into two beams TV & TX & these two beams arrive at the further surface of the glass, the beam TV which was refracted at the first surface after the usual manner, shall be again refracted entirely after the usual manner at the second surface & the beam TX which was refracted after the un-usual manner in the first surface shall be again refracted entirely after the unusual manner in the second surface, so that both these beams shall emerge out of the second surface in lines parallel to the first incident beam ST.
And if two pieces of Island Crystal be placed one after another in such manner that all the surfaces of the latter be parallel to all the corresponding surfaces of the former: the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first surface of the first crystal shall be refracted after the usual manner in all the following surfaces & the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface shall be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following surfaces. And the same thing happens tho the surfaces of the Crystalls be any ways inclined to one another provided their planes of perpendicular refraction be parallel to one another. 
And therefore there is an original difference in the rays of light by means of which some rays are in this experiment constantly refracted after the usual manner & others {are} constantly after the unusual manner. For if the difference be not original but arises from new modifications imprest on the rays at their first refraction, it would be altered by new modifications in the three following refractions: whereas it suffers no alteration but is constant & has the same effect upon the rays in all the refracti ons. The unusual refraction is therefore performed by an original property of the rays. And it remains to be enquired whether the rays have not more original properties then are yet discovered.
Qu. 18. Have not the rays of light several sides endued with several original properties? For if the planes of perpendicular refraction of the second crystal be at right angles with the planes of perpendicular refraction of the first crystal the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in passing through the first crystal will be all of them refracted after the unusuall manner in passing through the second crystal & the rays which are refracted after the unusuall manner in passing through the first crystal will all of them be refracted after the usual manner in passing through the second crystal. And therefore there are not two sorts of rays differing in their nature from one another, one of which is constantly & in all positions refracted after the usual manner & the other constantly & in all positions after the unusuall manner. The difference between the two sorts of rays in the experiment mentioned in the 19th Question was only in the positions of the sides of the rays to the planes of perpendicular refraction . For one & the same ray is here refracted sometimes after the usual & sometimes after the unusual manner according to the position which its sides have to the crystalls. If the sides of the ray are posited the same way to both crystalls it is refracted after the same manner in them both: but if that side of the ray which looks towards the coast of the unusual refraction of the first crystal <299r> be 90 degrees from that side of the same ray which looks towards the coast of the unusual refraction of the second crystal (which may be effected by varying the position of the second crystal to the first & by consequence to the rays of light) the ray shall be refracted after several manners in the several crystals. There is nothing more required to determin whether the rays which fall upon the second crystal shall be refracted after the usual or after the unusual manner but to turn about this crystall so that the coast of this crystalls unusual refraction may be on this or that side of the ray. And therefore every ray may be considered as having four sides or quarters two of which opposite to one another incline the ray to be refracted after the unusual manner as often as either of them are turned towards the coast of unusual refraction, & the other two whenever either of them are turned towards the coast of unusual refraction do not incline it to be otherwise refracted then after the usual manner. The two first may therefore be called the sides of unusual refraction, & the two last the sides of usual refraction. And since these dispositions were in th{e} rays before their incidence on the second third & fourth surfaces of the two crystals & suffered no alteration (so far as appears) by the refraction of the rays in their passage through those surfaces, & the rays were refracted by the same laws in all the four surfaces, it appears that those dispositions were in the the rays originally & suffered no alteration by the first refraction & that by means of those dispositions the rays were refracted at their incidence on the first surface of the first crystal some of them after the usual & some of them after the unusual manner accordingly as their sides of usual or unusual refraction were then turned towards the coast of the unusual refraction of that crystal. 
✝ < insertion from the middle of f 298v > ✝Every ray of light has therefore two opposite sides originally endued with a property on which the unusual refraction depends & other two opposite sides not endued with that property. And it remains to be enquired whether there are not more properties of light by which the sides of the rays differ & are distinguished from one another
In explaining the difference of the sides of the rays above mentioned I have supposed that the rays fall perpendicularly on the first crystal. But if they fall obliquely on it the success is the same. Those rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first crystal will be refracted after the unusual manner in the second crystal supposing the planes of perpendicular refraction to be at right angles with one another as above, & on the contrary.
If the planes of the perpendicular refraction of the two crystalls be neither parallel nor perpendicular to one another but contein an acute angle: the two beams of light which emerge out of the first crystal will be each of them divided into two more at their incidence on the second crystal. For in this case the rays in each of the two beams will some of them have their sides of usual refraction some of them their sides of unusual refraction turned towards the coast of the unusual refraction of the second crystal. < text from f 299r resumes >

Qu. 19. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous which have hitherto been invented for explaining the phenomena of light by new modifications of the rays. For those phenomena depend not upon new modifications, as has been supposed but upon the original & unchangeable properties of the rays.
Qu. 20. Are not all Hypotheses erroneous in which light is supposed to consist in pression or motion propagated through a fluid Medium? For in all these Hypothese the phænomena of light have been hitherto explained by supposing that they arise from new modifications of the rays: which is an erroneous supposition.
If light consisted only in pression propagated without actual motionit would not be able to agitate & heat the bodies which refract & reflect it. If it consisted in motion propagated to all distances in an instant, it would require an infinite force every moment in every shining particle to generate that motion. And if it consisted in pression or motion propagated either in an instant or in time it would bend into the shadow. For pression or motion cannot be propagated in a fluid in right lines beyond an obstacle which stops part of the motion, but will bend & spread every way into the quiescent medium which lyes beyond the obstacle. Gravity tends downwards, but the pressure of water arising from Gravity tends every way with equal force & is propagated as readily & with as much force through crooked passages as through streight ones. The waves on the surface of water passing by the sides of a broad obstacle bend & dilate themselves gradualy into the quiet water behind the obstacle. The waves pulses or vibrations of the Air wherein sounds consist bend manifestly, tho not so much as the waves of water. For a Bell or a Canon may be heard beyond a hill which intercepts the sight of the sounding body, & sounds are propagated as readily through crooked pipes as through streight ones. But light is never known to follow crooked passages nor to bend into the shadow. For the fixt stars by the interposition of any of the Planets cease to be seen, & so do the parts of the Sun by the interposition of the Moon Mercury or Venus. The rays which pass very near to the edges of any body are bent a little by the action of the body as we shewed above, but this bending is not towards but from the shadow & is performed only in the passage of the ray by the body & at a very small distance from it.. So soon as the ray is past the body, it goes right on.
To explain the unusual refraction of Island Crystal by pression or motion propagated has not hitherto been attempted (to my knowledge) except by Hugenius who for that end supposed two several vibrating Mediums within that Crystal. But when he tried the refractions in two successive pieces of that crystal & found them such as is mentioned above: he confessed himself at <301r> a loss for explaining them. For pressions or motions propagated from a shining body through an uniform Medium must be on all sides alike: whereas by those experiments it appears that the rays of light have different properties in their different sides. He suspected that the pulses of Æther in passing through the first crystal might receive certain new modifications which might determin them to be propagated in this or that Medium within the second crystal according to the position of that crystal, but what modifications those might be he could not say nor think of any thing satisfactory in that point.[2] And if had known that the unusual refraction depends not on new modifications but on the original & unchangeable dispositions of the rays, he would have found it as difficult to explain how those dispositions which he supposed to be imprest on the rays by the first Crystal could be in them before their incidence on that Crystal, & in general how all rays emitted by shining bodies can have those dispositions in them from the beginning. To me at least this seems inexplicable if light be nothing else then pression or motion propagated through Æther.
And it is as difficult to explain by these Hypotheses how rays can be alternately in fits of easy reflexion & easy transmission; unless perhaps one might suppose that there are in all space two ethereal vibrating Mediums & that the vibrations of one of them constitute light & that the vibrations of the other being swifter, as often as they overtake the vibrations of the first, put them into those fits. But to allow two æthers where we have no evidence for so much as one, to suppose that two æthers may be together in all spaces without mixing with one another so as to become one Medium & to suppose also that they may have distinct vibrations without making two sorts of light, are difficulties which I cannot get over. And that there are no such fluid Mediums I gather by the regular & very lasting motions of Planets & Comets through the heavens in all manner of positions: For hence it is manifest that the heavens are void of all sensible resistance, & by consequence of all sensible matter.
For the resisting power of fluid Mediums arises partly from the attrition of the parts of the Medium & partly from the Vis inertiæ of the matter. That part of the resistance of a spherical body which arises from the attrition of the parts of the Medium is as the factum of the diameter & the velocity of the spherical body very nearly & that part of the resistance which arises from the Vis inertiæ of the matter is as the square of that factum. And by this difference the two sorts of resistance may be distinguished from one another in any Medium & being distinguished it will be found that almost all the resistance of bodies of a competent magnitude moveing in Air Water & Quicksilver & such like fluids with a competent velocity arises from the Vis inertiæ of the parts of the fluid. 
Now that part of the resisting power of any Medium which arises from the tenacity or attrition of the parts of the Medium may be diminished by dividing

When I made these Observations I designed to repeat most of them with more care & exactness & to make some new ones for determining the manner how the rays of light are bent in their passage by bodies for making these fringes of colours with the dark lines between them: but I was then interrupted & cannot now think of taking these things into further consideration. And since I have not finished this part of my designe I shall conclude with proposing only some Quæres in order to a further search to be made by others. [who may take these things into consideration]
Quære 1. Do not Bodies act upon light at a distance & by their action bend its rays & is not this action strongest at the least distance. 1 B. Are not &c < insertion from the bottom of f 478r >  1 B. Are not the rays of light in passing by the edges & sides of bodies bent several times backwards, & forwards with a motion like that of an Eele. < text from f 477v resumes > 
2 Do not the rays which differ in refrangibility differ also in flexibility & are they not & by their different inflexions separated from one another so as after separation to make the colours in the three fringes above described. And after what manner are they inflected to make those fringes.
3 Do not the rays of light which fall upon bodies & are reflected or refracted begin to bend before they arive at the bodies, & are they not reflected refracted & inflected by one & the same Principle acting variously in various circumstances.
4 Do not light & bodies act mutually upon one another, that is to say bodies upon light in emitting reflecting refracting & inflecting it, & light mutu <478r> ally upon bodies for heating them & putting their parts into a vibrating motion wherein heat consists. And do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those ‡ < insertion from lower down f 478r > ‡ A) 4. {And} Do not black bodies conceive heat more easily from light then those of other colours do, by reason that the light falling on them is not reflected back but enters the bodies & is often reflected & refracted within them before it be stifled & lost. And is not the greatness or vigour the action between light & sulphureous bodies observed above one reason why sulphureous bodies take fire more readily & burn more vehemently then other bodies do? < text from f 478r resumes > 
5 Do not all fixt bodies when heated beyond a certain degree emit light by the vibrating motion of their parts.
6 Is not fire a body heated so hot as to emit light copiously. For what else is a red hot iron or a red hot stone then fire & what else is a burning coale then red hot wood whose heat is preserved by the action of an acid spirit in the air acting upon by dissolving the wood
7 Is not flame a vapour fume or exhalation heated red hot that is so hot as to shine For bodies do not flame which do not emit a copious fume.
8 Are not the sun & fixt stars great earths vehemently hot whose heat is conserved by the mutuall action & reaction between them & the light which they emit & whose parts are kept from fuming away by the vast weight of the Atmospheres incumbent upon them.
9 Do not the rays of light in falling upon the bottom of the eye excite vibrations in the Tunica retina which vibrations being propagated along the solid fibres of the Optick Nerves into the brain cause the sense of seeing. * < insertion from the bottom of f 478r > * For since dense bodies conserve their heat a long time & the densest bodies conserve their heat the longest, the vibrations of their parts are of a lasting nature & therefore may be propagated along solid fibres of uniform dense matter to a great distance for conveying into the brain the impressions made upon all the Organs of sense. For that motion which can continue long in one & the same part of a body can be propagated a long way from one part to another supposing the body homogeneal so that the motion may not be reflected refracted interrupted or disordered by any uneavenness of the body. < text from f 478r resumes > 10 Do not several sorts of rays make vibrations of several bignesses, which according to their bignesses excite sensations of several colours much after the manner that the vibrations of the air according to their several bignesses excite sensations of several sounds? And particularly do not the most refrangible rays excite the shortest vibrations for making a sensation of deep violet, the least refrangible the largest for making a sensation of deep red & the several intermediate sorts of rays vibrations of several intermediate bignesses to make sensations of the several intermediate colours?
11 May not the harmony & discord of colours arise from the proportions of the vibrations propagated through the optic nerves into the brain as the harmony & discord of sounds arises from the proportions of the vibrations of the air. For some colours are agreable as those of gold & Indigo & others disagree.
12. Are not the species of objects seen with both eyes united where the Optick nerves meet before they come into the brain: the fibres on the right side of both Nerves uniting there & after union going thence into the brain in the nerve which is on the right side of the head & the fibres on the left side of both nerves uniting in the same place & after union going into the brain in the nerve which is on the left side of the head & these two nerves meeting in the brain in such a manner that their fibres make but one intire species half of which on the right side of the sensorium comes from the right side of both eyes & the other half of which on the left side of the sensorium comes from the left side of both eyes? For the optic nerves of such animals as look the same way with both eyes (as of Men, Doggs, Sheep, Oxen) meet before they go into the brain, but the optic nerves of such animals as do not look the same way with both eyes (as of Fishes & the Chameleon) do not meet i{f} I am rightly informed.

Besides the Refractions hitherto described, there is a refraction of another kind made in Island-glass, which is a sort of Talc or pellucid stone found in Island, in the form of an {illeg} parallelopiped, clear as crystall splitting in glossy planes parallel to any of its sides, & enduring a violent fire without fusion. The obtuse angles of its sides or surfaces being 101 degr 52′, & the acute ones 78 degr 8′ each 
If a beam of light fall perpendicularly upon any surface of this glass, this beam in passing through that {surface} shall part into two beams one of which shall go perpendicularly through the glass {illeg} to do according to the rules of Opticks & the other beam shall start {illeg}varicate from the former beam in an angle of about 6° 40′ & when it arrives {illeg} other side of the glass falling upon it obliquely in an angle of 83° 20′ it shall {illeg} perpendicularly out of the glass. And if the beame of light fall upon the first surface of the glass in any oblique {illeg} {this} beame shall there divide into two beames one of which shall be refracted {according} to the known laws of Opticks the sine of incidence being to the sine of refraction {illeg}, & the other shall be refracted according to another law.
This {illeg} {instance} with its wonderfull refraction was first described by Erasmus Bartholine {illeg} more exactly by Hugenius in his Treatise of light written {illeg} ABCDEF represent  a p{illeg} bounded with six parallelogram sides or six {illeg} whose {obtuse} angles are each of them 101° 52′ & their acute ones 68° 8′. And let three of the obtuse angles lye about the solid angle C & other three about the opposite solid angle E the other six solid angles being composed each of them with one obtuse & two acute ones And let the two biggest solid angles C & E composed of three obtuse ones be called the principal solid angles. & the plane which is perpendicular to the refracting surfaces & bisects either of their obtuse angles be called the principal planes. And let ST represent a beam of light falling on the first surface of the glass AB at the point T & being there refracted. This beam ST shall divide it self into two beams TV & TX some of the rays in the beam ST being refracted according to the known law of Opticks & going in the beam TV to the place V in the further surface of the glass the sine of the refraction of these rays being to the sine of their incidence as 3 to 5. And the rest of the rays in the beam ST being refracted according to another law & going in the beam TX to another place X in the further surface of the glass. which place X is thus found.
<610v>
Find the line N which is in such proportion to the thickness of the glass or distance between the two refracting surfaces as the sine of 6° 40′ is to the Radius. Then from the point V upon the further surface of the glass draw he line VK equal to the line N & parallel to the lines which bisect the obtuse angle F of the further surface which is adjacent to one of the lesser solid angles, & you will have to point X to which the beam TX shal go.
Ph. 3 When these two beams of light TV & TX arrive at the further surface of the glass the beam TV which was refracted at the first surface after the usual manner shall be again refracted entirely after the usual manner at the second surface & the beam TX which was refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface shall be again refracted entirely after the unusuall manner in the second so that both these beams shall emerge out of the second surface in lines parallel to the first incident beam ST.
Ph. 4 If two or more pieces of Island glass be placed one after another in such manner that all the surfaces of the latter be parallel to all the corresponding surfaces of the first, the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first surface of the first glass will be refracted after the usual manner in all the following surfaces & the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface will be refracted after the unusual manner in all the following surfaces. And therefore there is a difference in the rays of light by means of which one sort of rays is constantly refracted after the usuall manner & the other sort constantly after the unusual manner; & this difference was in the rays before their first refraction as well as before the latter refractions because it had the same effect upon them in all the refractions.
Ph. 5 And tho the surfaces of the glasses are any ways inclined to one another yet if their planes of perpendicular refraction be parallel to one another the rays which are refracted after the usual manner in the first surface are refracted after the usual manner in all the following surfaces & the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in the first surface are refracted after the unusuall manner in all the following surfaces.
Ph. 6. But if the planes of perpendicular refraction of the second glass be at right angles with the planes of perpendicular refraction of the first glass: the rays which are refracted after the usuall manner in passing through the first glass will all of them be refracted after the unusual manner in passing through the second glass & the rays which are refracted after the unusual manner in passing through the first glass will all of them be refracted after the usual manner in passing through the second glass. And therefore there are not two sorts of rays differing in nature from one another one of which is refracted constantly & in all positions after the usual manner & the other constantly & in all positions after the unusual manner The difference in the foregoing experiment was only in the position of the sides of the ray to the coast of unusual refraction For by this experiment it appears that one & the same way is refracted sometimes in the usual & sometimes in the unsual manner according to the position which its sides have to the glass. not according to the position or bigness of the angle of incidence but according to the position of the sides of the ray to the planes of perpendicular refraction of the glass. Let every ray be conceived to have four sides or quadrants two of them opposite to one another which incline the ray to be refracted unusually & other two opposits which do not incline it to
<611v>
And let the planes which are perpendicular to the refracting surfaces of the glass & parallel to the lines which bisect the other {illeg}angles of that parallelogram surface be called the planes of perpendicular refraction. For if a {beam} of light fall perpendicularly upon any surface of this glass it shall at the point of incide{nce} divide into two beames one of which shall go perpendicularly into the glass as it ought to do by the usual rules of Opticks, the other shall start aside & diaricate from the perpendicular ray making with it an angle of 6° 40′, & going through the glass in the plane of perpendicular refraction & bending from the perpendicular towards the sides of the glass which with the refracting plane comprehend one of the two begger solid angles. Let ST represent the beam incident at T perpendicularly on the surface ACBD, & this beam at the point of incidence T shall become divided into {the} beame TV & TX one of which TV shall go perpendicularly into the glass, the other TX shall shall go into it obliquely making with the perpendicular an angle VTX of 6° 40′ [who{se} plane VTX is parallel to the planes of perpendicular refraction] & {illeg} from it in the plane of perpendicular refraction VTX towards th{e} {illeg} of the glass AF & BF which with the refracting surface AB {conteine} the solid angle C which is one of the two biggest solid angles. let the two rays TV & TX fall upon the further side of the glass EF at the points V & X & draw the line VX [& this line VX will be to the thickness of the glass or distance between the planes AB & EF as the tangent of 6 40 to the radius & be parallel to the lines which bisect the obtuse angles E & F of that further side of the glass]
Now let ST represent any other beam of light incident obliquely on {AB} the first surface of the glass AB & let the point of incidence be T & this beam shall also be divided at the point of incidence T into two beams TV & TX one of which TV shal be refracted after the usual manner, the sine of incidence being to the sine of refraction as five to three, Let this beame fall upon the further surface of the glass EF at the point V. Draw the line VX equal & parallel to the line VX. Draw it the same way from V which the line VX lies from V & joyning TX this line TX shall be the other beam of light carried by the unusual refraction from T to V.
When these two beams &c

Qu. 23. By what means do bodies act on one another at a distance. The ancient Philosophers who held Atoms & Vacuum attributed gravity to Atoms without telling us the means unless perhaps in figures: as by calling God Harmony & representing him & matter by the God Pan & his Pipe, or by calling the Sun the prison of Jupiter because he keeps the Planets in their orbs. Whence it seems to have been an ancient opinion that matter depends upon a Deity for its laws of motion as well as for its existence. The Cartesians make God the author of all motion & its as reasonable to make him the author of the laws of motion. Matter is a passive principle & cannot move it self. It continues in its state of moving or resting unless disturbed. It receives motion proportional to the force impressing it. And resists as much as it is resisted. These are passive laws & to affirm that there are no other is to speak against experience. For we find in our selves a power of moving our bodies by our thought Life & will are active Principles by which we move our bodies, & thence arise other laws of motion unknown to us.
And since all matter duly formed is attended with signes of life & all things are framed with perfect art & wisdom & Nature does nothing in vain; if there be an universal life & all space be the sensorium of a thinking being who by immediate presence perceives all things in it as that which thinks in us perceives | see their pictures in the brain: the laws of motion arising from life or will may be of universal extent.
— those laws. To some such laws the ancient Philosophers seem to have elluded when they called God H{arm}ony, & signified his actuating matter harmonicaly by the God Pan's playing upon a Pipe & attribute musick to the spheres made the distances & motions of the heavenly bodies to be harmonical, & represented the Planets by the seven strings of Apollo's Harp. 
——— If you think that the Vis inertia is sufficient for conserving motion, pray tell me the Experiments from whence you gather this conclusion. Do you learn by any experiment that the beating of the heart give no new motion to the blood, that the explosion of Gunpouder gives no new motion to {a} bullet or that a man by his will can give no new motion to his body? Or do you learn by experiment that the beating of the heart takes away as much motion from something else as it gives to the blood or that explosion takes away as much motion rom something else as it gives to a bullet or that a man by his will takes away as much motion from something else as he gives to his body? If so, tell me your experiments {;} if not, your opinion is Reasoning without experience is very slippery. A man may puzzle me by arguments against local{ized} motion but I'le beleive my eyes. A man may may bring plausible arguments against the power of the will but I'le beleive experience. A man may argue plausibly for blind fate against final causes but I find by experience that I am constantly aiming at something. Were it not for experience I should not know that matter is heavy or impenetrable or moveable or that I think or am or that there is matter or any thing else. And therefore to affirm any thing more then I know by experience & good reasoning upon it is precarious. Even arguments for a Being if not taken from Phænomena are slippery & serve only for ostentation. An Atheist will allow that there is a Being absolutely perfect, necessarily existing & the author of mankind & call it Nature: & if you talk of infinite wisdom or of any perfection more then he allows to {say} in {natur} heel reccon at a chemæra & tell you that you have the notion of finite or limited wisdom from what you find in your self & are able of your self to {prefin} the word no{t} or more then to any verb or adjective & without the existence of wisdome not limited or wisdome more then finite to understand the meaning of the phrase as easily as Mathematicians understand what is meant by an infinite line or an infinite area. And heel may tell you further that the

And While these powers are of so large extent, I do not see but that they may be numbred among the general laws of motion. The Vis inertiæ is a passive principle by which bodies persist in their motion or rest, receive motion in proportion to the force impressing it & resist as much as they are resisted: By this principle alone there could never have been any motion in the world. Thinking is an active principle by which we move our bodies according to our will, & thence arise other laws of motion unknown to us, which if {all} the Universe be the sensorium of a thinking Being, may be of greater entent. Gravity was recconed among the laws of motion by the ancient Philosphers who attributed gravity to their Atoms in vacuo, & the forces above mentioned by which smal bodies act on one another at small distances may have a good a title as gravity to be recconed among those laws.
But while I call those forces attraction & repulse I would not be understood to define the cause or manner of the action. That which I call attraction may be done by impulse or by some other meane unknown to me. I only use that word to signify a force by which bodies tend towards one another whatever perfect Art & be the cause duly formed is attended with signes of life:                         & if since all things are framed with wisdome & Nature does nothing in vain all matter if there be an universal life & all space be the sensorium of a thinking Being & finite things {illeg} be instead of their sensible pictures formed by motion in our Brain; those laws may be of Universal extent.
I have hitherto been arguing from the effects to their causes & carried the argument up to certain forces by which little bodies act on one another at small distances. These forces may be recconed among the laws of motion, but whether they depend on Bodies alone considered only a long broad & thick bodies alone may be a question For are passive. By their vis inertiæ they continue in their state of moving or resting & receive motion proportional to the force impressing it & resiste as much as they are resisted, but they cannot move themselves; & without some other principle then the vis inertiæ there could be no motion in the world. And if there be another Principle of motion there must be other laws of motion depending on that Principle. And the first thing to be done in Philosophy is to find out all the general laws of motion on which the frame of nature depends. We find in our selves a power of moving our bodies by our thoughts ] & see the same power in other living creatures but how this is done & by what laws we do not know. We cannot say that all Nature is not alive. not know her laws or powers any further then we gather them from Phænomena. 
If the body is compact & bends or yealds inward to pression without any sliding of its parts, it is hard & elastic returning to its figure with a force arising from the mutual attraction of its parts. If the parts slide upon one another the body is maleable and soft. If they slip easily & are of a size most apt to be agitated by heat & the heat is big enough to keep its parts in agitation the body is fluid, & if it be apt to stick to things it is humid; & the drops of every fluid affect a round figure by the mutual attraction of its parts as the globe of the earth & sea affects a round figure by the mutual attraction of its parts by gravity.

But how two Æthers can be diffused through all space one of which acts upon the other & by consequence is reacted upon, without retarding slackening shattering & confounding one anothers motions, is inconceivable. And against filling the heavens with fluid Medium unless they be exceeding rare a great objection arises from the regular & very lasting motions of the Planets & Comets through the heavens in all — — —
By a vacuum I do not mean a space void of all substances. Glass cannot attract light without a Medium. I mean only such a Vacuum as may be made by drawing Aer out of a vessel of glass.
What I mean in this Question by a Vacuum, & the attractions of the rays of light towards the glass or crystall, may be understood by what was said in the 18th Question.
Now in bodies — — — — — forces more easily. And for the like reason Gravity in the surfaces of small globes is greater in proportion to the globes then in the surfaces of great globes of equal density. And therefore since the rays of light are the smallest bodies yet known to us (For I do not here consider the particles of æther) we may expect to find their attractions very strong. And how strong they are may be gatherred by this Rule — — — — — — —; — to be above an hundred million of millions of millions of times greater in proportion to the matter in them then the gravity of the Earth towards the Sunn in proportion to the matter in it.
As attraction is stronger in small magnets then in great ones in proportion to their bulk, & gravity is greater in the surfaces of small Planets then in those of great ones in proportion to their bulk so the smallness of the rays of light may very much contribute to the force by which they are refracted. And so if any one should suppose that Ether (like our aer) may {containe} particles which endeavour to recede from one another (for I do not know what the Ether is) & that its particles are exceedingly smaller then those of aer, or even the{ir} those of light, the the exceeding smalness of its particles may contribute to the greatness of the force by which those particles recede from one another & thereby make that medium exceedingly more rare & elastick then Aer.
And that the gravity of the Planets towards the Sun may not be thought too great to be produced by the cause of gravity here suggested: upon a fair computation it will found that the gravity of our earth towards the Sun in proportion to the quantity of its matter is above ten hundred millions of millions of millions of millions of times less then the force by which a ray of light in entring into glass or crystall is drawn or f{orced} impelled towards the refracting body. And therefore the gravity of the earth towards the Sun requires a variation of the density of the Ether at the Orb of the Earth an hundred millions of millions of millions of millions of times slower then the variation of the density of the Ether at the surface of glass or crystal requisite to refract light. For the velocity of light is to the velocity of the Earth in the Orbis magnus as 58 days the time in the Earth describes the ; that is an earth equal to the radius of its orb to about 7 minutes, the time in which light comes fro  to {as} as about 12000 to 1. And the the curvity of a ray of light during it refraction at the surface of glass on which it falls very obliquely, is to the curvity of the earths Orb, as the radius of that Orb to the radius of the curvity of the ray or as above 1000000000000000000 to 1. And the force which bends the ray is to the force which keeps the earth or any Projectile in its orb or line of Projection in a ratio compounded of the duplicate ratio of the velocities & this ratio of the curvities of the lines of projection.
The Atmosphere by its weight presses the Quicksilver into the glass to the height of 29 or 30 inches. And some other Agent raises it higher, not by pressing it into the glass but by making its parts stick to the glass & to one another. For upon any discontinuation of parts made either by bubbles or by shaking the glass, the whole liquor falls down.

For all Metaphysicks not founded upon experience is Hypothetical: And so far as Metaphysical Propositions are founded upon experience they are a part of experimental Philosophy. Even that celebrated Proposition Ego cogito ergo sum is known to us by experience. We know that we think by an inward sensation of our thoughts. And therefore from that Proposition we cannot conclude that any thing more is true then what we deduce from experience < insertion from lower down f 622r > 
And even in proving a Deity all aguments not taken from Phænomena are little better then dreams. Now {altho} the arguing from experiments & observations by Induction be no demonstration of general Propositions, yet it is the best way of

If two plane polished plates of glass three or four inches broad & about twenty long be laid one of them parallel to the horizon the other upon the first so as to touch it & make an angle with it. of about 10 or 15 minutes at one of their ends & the same be first moistened on their inward sides with a cleane cloth dipt into oyle of Oranges, & rubbed upon it & a drop or two of the oyle be let fall upon he lower glass at the other end: so soon as the upper glass is laid down upon the lower so as to touch it at one end & to touch the drop at the other end making with the lower glass an angle of about 10 or 15 as above; the drop will begin to move towards the concourse of the glasses & will continue to move with an accelerated motion till it arrives at that concourse of the glasses. [And if you then open the glasses where they met & touched & make them meet & touch at their other end in the same acute angle as before; the drop will run back to that end of the glasses where they now touch, & where it was at first.] For the two glasses attract the drop, & by the attraction make it run that way towards which the attractions incline. And if when the drop is in motion you lift up that end of the glasses where they meet & towards which the drop moves: the drop will ascend between the glasses, & therefore is attracted. And as you lift up the glasses, more & more the drop will ascend slower & slower & at length rest. And when you see it rest you may reccon that it then carried downward by its weight as much as upwards by the attraction. And thereby you may know the force by which the drop is attracted at all distances from the contact of the glasses. And by some experiments, the attraction is almost reciprocally as in a duplicate proportion of the distance of the {middle} of the drop from the concours of the glasses. viz reciprocally in a simple proportion by reason of the spreading of the drop & its touching the glasses in alarger surface; & again reciprocally in a simple proportion by reason of the attractions growing stronger within the same quantity of attracting surface. The attraction therefore within the same quantity of surface is reciprocally as the distance between the glasses. And therefore where the distance is very small, suppose the ten-thousand-thousandth part of an inch, the attraction must be exceeding great; so great perhaps as within in a circle of an inch in diameter to suffice to hold up a weight equal to a cylinder of water of an inch in diameter, & above a mile in length. There are therefore Agents in Nature able to to make the particles of bodies attract one another very strongly & to stick together strongly those by attractions. One of those Agents may be the Æther above mentioned whereby light is refracted. Another may be the Agent or Spirit which causes electrical attraction. For tho this Agent acts not at great distances except when it is excited by the friction of electrick bodies: yet it may act perpetually at very small distances without friction, & that not only in bodies accounted electric, but also in some others. And there are still other mediums which may cause attractions, (such as are the Magnetick effluvia; it is the business of experimental Philosophy to find out all these Mediums with their properties.
Now the smallest particles of matter may cohere
By the Table in the second part of the second Book wherein the thicknesses of coloured plates of water between two glasses are set down, the thickness of the plate where it appears very black is three eighths of the thousand-thousandth part of an inch. And where the Oyle of Oranges between the glasses is of this thickness, the attraction seems to be so strong as within a circle of an inch in diameter to suffice to hold up a weight equal to that of a cylinder of water of an inch in diameter & two or three furlongs in lenghth And where it is of a less thickness the attraction may be proportionally greater. & increase untill the thickness be no bigger then that of a single particle of water.

The parts — — — — any sensible effect. All bodies — — — — difficult to conceive The same thing — — — — cohesion of its parts. It is not therefore by the pressure of the Æther upon the outside of the Marbles or Mercury (tho such a pressure may contribute to the effect) but by the action of either that or some other Medium or Mediums upon the inward parts of those bodies by which the contiguous parts of the Marbles & those of the glass & Mercury stick to one another. The like Experiment hath been tried with water — — — — amongst themselves.
And of the same kind with these Experiments are those that follow. If two plane polished plates of glass (suppose two pieces of a broken looking-glass) bee laid together so that their sides be parallel & at a very small distance from one another; & then their lower edges be dipped into water; the water will rise up between them. And the less the distance of the glasses is the greater will be the height to which the water will rise. If the distance be about the hundreth part of an inch, the water will rise to the light of about an inch & if the distance be greater or less in any proportion, the height will be reciprocally proportional to the distance very nearly. For the attractive force of the glasses is the same whether the distance between them be greater or less & the weight of the water drawn up is the same if the height of it be reciprocally proportional to the distance between the glasses. [And in like manner water ascends between two Marbles polished plane, when their polished sides are parallel , & at a very little distance from one another.] And if slender pipes of glass be dipt at one end into stagnating water the water will rise up within the pipe & the hight to which it rises will be reciprocally proportional to the diameter of the cavity of the pipe & will equall the height to which it rises between two planes of glass if the semidiameter of the cavity of the Pipe be equal to the distance between the planes, or thereabouts. And these experiments suceed after the same manner in vacuo as in the open air, & therefore are not influenced by the weight or pressure of the Atmosphere.
And if a wide pipe of glass be filled with sifted ashes well pressed together in the glass & one end of the pipe be dipped into stagnating water; the water will rise up slowly in the glass so as in the space of a week or afortnight to reach up to 30 or 40 inches above the surface of the stagnating water. And the water is raised to this height by the attraction of those particles of the ashes only which are upon the surface of the elevated water; the particles which are within the water, attracting it as much downwards as upwards. And therefore the attraction is very strong but it would be much stronger if the ashes upon the surface of the attracted water were one continued body, as the glass is which keeps quicksilver suspended to the hight of above 60 or 70 inches, & therefore attracts with a force which would keep water suspended to the height of above fifty feet. And the particles of glass, which lie closer to one another then they do or the quicksilver {mor} attracts one another with a force much stronger.
